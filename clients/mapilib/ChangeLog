# ChangeLog file for mapilib
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Tue Aug  1 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The functions mapi_error_str and mapi_result_error now return const char
  * instead of plain char * to indicate that the returned data belongs
  to the library and should not be changed or freed by the application.
- New function const char *mapi_result_errorcode(MapiHdl) which returns
  the SQLSTATE code if available when an error has occurred.
