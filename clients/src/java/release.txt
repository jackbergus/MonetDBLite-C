RELEASE NOTES
MonetDB JDBC driver version 1.5 (Steadfast_pre5)
Fabian Groffen <Fabian.Groffen@cwi.nl>

Release date: 2006-12-07


This JDBC driver is designed for use with MonetDB, a main-memory
database.  For more information see http://monetdb.cwi.nl/.

Within the current implementation not all functionalities of the JDBC
interface are available.  It is believed, however, that this
implementation is rich enough to be suitable for a majority of
application settings.

Below a list of supported features can be found.  Please read this list
if you intend to use this driver.  If you feel some features are
missing, please let us know at our SourceForge feature request page:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=56967&atid=482471

Feel free to file bugs, when they appear, at our SourceForge bug page as
well.


Currently implemented:
  * java.sql.Driver interface
  * javax.sql.DataSource interface (not tested)
  * java.sql.Connection interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - createStatement with result set holdability
    - nativeSQL (there is no query parsing for JDBC escapes yet)
    - prepareCall (CallableStatement not supported)
    - prepareStatement with more than just an SQL prepare statement
    - setCatalog (there is no catalog management yet)
    - getHoldability/setHoldability (close/hold cursors over commit is
      not configurable)
    - isReadOnly/setReadOnly (updateable result sets are not supported at
      all)

    NOTE: be sure to check for warnings after setting concurrencies or
          isolation levels; MonetDB currently does not support anything
          else but "fully serializable" transactions.
  * java.sql.Statement interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - cancel/getQueryTimeout/setQueryTimeout (query execution cannot be
      terminated, once started)
    - execute with more than just an SQL query
    - executeUpdate with more than just an SQL query
    - getGeneratedKeys
    - getMaxFieldSize/setMaxFieldSize
    - setCursorName
    - setEscapeProcessing
  * java.sql.PreparedStatement interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - getMetaData
    - setArray
    - setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, setUnicodeStream
    - setBlob
    - setBytes
    - setRef, setURI
  * java.sql.ResultSet interface
    The next features are not implemented:
    - getArray
    - getAsciiStream, getBinaryStream, getUnicodeStream, getCharacterStream
    - getBlob
    - getRef, getURL
    - all methods related to updateable result sets
    * java.sql.ResultSetMetaData interface
  * java.sql.DatabaseMetaData interface
  * java.sql.SavePoint interface

- The get/setObject methods currently ignore any given type map.
- Auto-commit behaviour is defined by the server which handles the
  auto-commit.  This is in general in line with the JDBC standard.
