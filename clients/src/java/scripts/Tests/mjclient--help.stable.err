stderr of test 'mjclient--help` in directory 'src/java/scripts` itself:


# 16:36:12 >  
# 16:36:12 >  Mtimeout -timeout 300 ./mjclient--help mjclient--help 
# 16:36:12 >  


# 07:35:51 >  
# 07:35:51 >  Mtimeout -timeout 60 mjclient --help
# 07:35:51 >  

= Please remove this line in case mjclient's usage message is supposed to go to stdout instead of stderr (as usually).

# 15:14:07 >  
# 15:14:07 >  Done.
