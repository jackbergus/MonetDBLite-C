#  GNU's gcc does not like to compile swig-generated code
#  (at least not with our strict X_CFLAGS), complaining about
#  "warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules",
#  "warning: unused variable '...'",
#  "warning: '...' defined but not used", and/or
#  'error: "..." is not defined'.
#  Hence, we use GCC_SWIG_CFLAGS to disable the respective warning
#  as locally as possbile via "-Wno-strict-aliasing -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-function -Wno-undef".
#  Intel's icc does not like to compile swig-generated code

#  'error #177: function "..." was declared but never referenced', and/or
#  'error #310: old-style parameter list (anachronism)'.
#  Hence, we use ICC_SWIG_CFLAGS to disable the respective warning
