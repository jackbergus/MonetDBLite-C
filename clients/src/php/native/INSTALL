= How to install =

In order to get the native monetdb PHP implementation to work you need
a PHP5 interpreter with socket support compiled and enabled.

You can verify wether your interpreter has sockets support compiled by running the command:

$ php-config --configure-options

and check for the presence of the "--enable-sockets" option.

In order to enable sockets support in your php interpreter; 
load the php_sockets.so library from the php.ini configuration file.

extension=php_sockets.so


Finally to use the native PHP interface in your application include the "lib/php_monetdb.php"
in all pages that want to make use of a database connection.
