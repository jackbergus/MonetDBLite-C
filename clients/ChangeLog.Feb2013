- ODBC: Fixed interpretation SQL_C_SLONG/SQL_C_ULONG/SQL_C_LONG to
  refer to a 32 bit integer always (i.e. "int" on 64 bit architectures
  despite the name and the Microsoft documentation).  This seems to be
  the consensus.
- ODBC: Fixed transaction level: MonetDB only supports the highest level
  (SQL_TXN_SERIALIZABLE), so setting the transaction level can be accepted
  and ignored.
