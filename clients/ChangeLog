- In SQL mode, always use the table formatter, as there is no sense to
  use raw (protocol debug) mode when reading from pipe or file really.
  People likely prefer tab (-ftab) formatting in such case for easy
  scripting.

- In SQL (rendering) mode, mclient now returns timings for SELECT and
  UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries next to the number of tuples returned or
  rows affected.
