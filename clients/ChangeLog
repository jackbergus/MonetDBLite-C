- The functions in the mapi library that require 64 bit integers now
  use the standard type int64_t instead of the non-standard mapi_int64.
  This requires a compilation environment that has the stdint.h include
  file (standardized in C99).  Compilation of the library also requires
  the inttypes.h include file (also standardized in C99).

- Add a new pretty printing option to stethoscope
  Running stethoscope with the flag -j will produce not pretty printed
  output (one json object per line). Running with the -y flag will produce
  pretty printed output. Running with neither, wiil produce the legacy,
  line oriented format
