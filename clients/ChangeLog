bogus message for testing commit messages

* Wed Mar 31 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl>
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainy for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can now be
  built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".
  Files that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on Windows,
  requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably) requiring a
  rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Wed Mar 24 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl>
- Implemented build directory support for Windows,
  i.e., like on Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate
  build directory as alternative to ...<package>NT, and thus keep the
  latter clean from files generated during the build.
  On Windows, the build directory must be a sibling of ...<package>NT .

* Mon Mar 29 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Changed \d output of mclient no longer to list (internal use only) system tables.  Administrator users who like to inspect these tables can use SELECT * FROM tables; instead

* Wed Mar 17 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Implemented the changes required for properly running ODBC on a 64-bit platform.

* Mon Mar 01 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Added stethoscope, an utility to profile MonetDB5 instances,
  originally from the MonetDB5 repository.
