# ChangeLog file for clients
# This file is updated with Maddlog

-   Empty resultsets now show a header in mclient using SQL mode.

* Wed Aug 18 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Allow users to specify their own default formatter (using format=), or
  their default formatting width (using width=) in their .monetdb file.
  Setting the latter option is mostly useful when using the sql
  formatter, such that truncation can be disabled by setting width=-1.
- Rendering of mclient's tabular mode (when using SQL) has been changed
  considerably to get improved output.  Most importantly it now omits
  parts of field values or even full columns when the used terminal width
  is insufficient to display the result.  To disable this behaviour,
  simply set width to -1 (via -w option or \w in mclient), or chose
  another rendering mode.

* Wed Jul 21 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- In SQL mode, always use the table formatter, as there is no sense to
  use raw (protocol debug) mode when reading from pipe or file really.
  People likely prefer tab (-ftab) formatting in such case for easy
  scripting.

* Thu Jul 15 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- In SQL (rendering) mode, mclient now returns timings for SELECT and
  UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries next to the number of tuples returned or
  rows affected.
