- ODBC: Changed table types as used by SQLTables from "LOCAL TEMPORARY"
  and "GLOBAL TEMPORARY" to "LOCAL TEMPORARY TABLE" and "GLOBAL TEMPORARY
  TABLE" respectively.

* Wed Jan 31 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- ODBC: Initial support for the HUGEINT type in SQL was added.  Any value
  with type HUGEINT can be retrieved in a C variable with type SQL_C_CHAR
  or SQL_C_WCHAR.  A value of type HUGEINT can be retrieved in other C
  types as long as they fit, the largest C type supported being a 64 bit
  integer (equivalent to BIGINT).

* Thu Nov 16 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The functions in the mapi library that require 64 bit integers now
  use the standard type int64_t instead of the non-standard mapi_int64.
  This requires a compilation environment that has the stdint.h include
  file (standardized in C99).  Compilation of the library also requires
  the inttypes.h include file (also standardized in C99).

* Mon Jul 17 2017 Panagiotis Koutsourakis <kutsurak@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Add a new pretty printing option to stethoscope
  Running stethoscope with the flag -j will produce not pretty printed
  output (one json object per line). Running with the -y flag will produce
  pretty printed output. Running with neither, wiil produce the legacy,
  line oriented format
