- Rendering of mclient's tabular mode (when using SQL) has been changed
  considerably to get improved output.  Most importantly it now omits
  parts of field values or even full columns when the used terminal width
  is insufficient to display the result.  To disable this behaviour,
  simply set width to -1 (via -w option or \w in mclient), or chose
  another rendering mode.

- In SQL mode, always use the table formatter, as there is no sense to
  use raw (protocol debug) mode when reading from pipe or file really.
  People likely prefer tab (-ftab) formatting in such case for easy
  scripting.

- In SQL (rendering) mode, mclient now returns timings for SELECT and
  UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries next to the number of tuples returned or
  rows affected.
