# ChangeLog file for clients
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed Mar 24 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl>
- Implemented build directory support for Windows,
  i.e., like on Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate
  build directory as alternative to ...<package>NT, and thus keep the
  latter clean from files generated during the build.
  On Windows, the build directory must be a sibling of ...<package>NT .

* Mon Mar 29 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Changed \d output of mclient no longer to list (internal use only) system tables.  Administrator users who like to inspect these tables can use SELECT * FROM tables; instead

* Wed Mar 17 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Implemented the changes required for properly running ODBC on a 64-bit platform.

* Mon Mar 01 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Added stethoscope, an utility to profile MonetDB5 instances,
  originally from the MonetDB5 repository.
