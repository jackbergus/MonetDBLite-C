- Fixed bug 2897 where slow (network) reads could cause blocks to not
  be fully read in one go, causing errors in the subsequent use of
  those blocks.  With thanks to RÃ©my Chibois.

- Fixed a bug in mclient where processing queries from files could result
  in ghost empty results to be reported in the output
