* Mon Oct 10 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Fixed a source of crashes in mclient when a query on the command line
  using the -s option is combined with input on standard input (e.g. in
  the construct mclient -s 'COPY INTO t FROM STDIN ...' < file.csv).

* Fri Oct  7 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Fixed bug 2897 where slow (network) reads could cause blocks to not
  be fully read in one go, causing errors in the subsequent use of
  those blocks.  With thanks to RÃ©my Chibois.

* Tue Sep 27 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Fixed a bug in mclient where processing queries from files could result
  in ghost empty results to be reported in the output
