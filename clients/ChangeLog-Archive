* Fri Nov 19 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.3-20101215
- Workaround usage of strncat to solve mclient/mapilib aborts from
  bug #2725

* Fri Nov 12 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.40.3-20101215
- Fixed a corner case in the table display code.

* Thu Oct 28 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101029
- Fix crash when the server disconnects during \d query

* Wed Oct 27 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.40.1-20101029
- A manual page for the msqldump program was added.
- Mclient now recognizes the file name "-" to refer to its standard
  input.

* Fri Oct  1 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.40.1-20101029
- Save readline history as we go along.  This fixes bug 2632.

* Tue Sep 14 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.40.1-20101029
- The \d and \D commands now require a space if they are followed by a
  table name.  This is to accomodate future expansion where \d and \D
  could be immediately followed by another letter to indicate the type
  of object of interest.
- Implemented dumping of "external" functions.  This fixes bug 2546.

* Thu Aug 26 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101029
- Empty resultsets now show a header in mclient using SQL mode.

* Wed Aug 18 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101029
- Allow users to specify their own default formatter (using format=), or
  their default formatting width (using width=) in their .monetdb file.
  Setting the latter option is mostly useful when using the sql
  formatter, such that truncation can be disabled by setting width=-1.
- Rendering of mclient's tabular mode (when using SQL) has been changed
  considerably to get improved output.  Most importantly it now omits
  parts of field values or even full columns when the used terminal width
  is insufficient to display the result.  To disable this behaviour,
  simply set width to -1 (via -w option or \w in mclient), or chose
  another rendering mode.

* Wed Jul 21 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101029
- In SQL mode, always use the table formatter, as there is no sense to
  use raw (protocol debug) mode when reading from pipe or file really.
  People likely prefer tab (-ftab) formatting in such case for easy
  scripting.

* Thu Jul 15 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101029
- In SQL (rendering) mode, mclient now returns timings for SELECT and
  UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries next to the number of tuples returned or
  rows affected.

* Fri Sep 10 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.40.1-20101029
- A bug was fixed (bug 2639) where using completion failed with an error
  when using another schema than "sys".

* Thu Aug 19 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.5-20100823
- mclient now complains about NULL bytes in the input when in interactive
  mode.

* Fri Aug 13 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Slight rendering improvements to mclient's tabular output when
  rendering results larger than the available screen width, headers
  were previously unnecessarily squeezed.
- Fix bug #2650, a too small buffer caused the active database as
  reported by mclient's welcome message to be truncated

* Wed Jul 21 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Add --version option to mclient.

* Tue Jul 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.5-20100823
- In case of an incomplete line from the server, add a newline.
  This fixes bug 2619.

* Mon Jul 19 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Avoid using SQLROWSETSIZE and SQLROWOFFSET.
  This fixes bug 2558.

* Mon Jul  5 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.3-20100706
- Implemented dumping of GRANT statements.
  This fixes bug 2574.

* Thu Jul  1 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.3-20100706
- Fix implementation of mapi_mapiuri to deal with UNIX socket urls
  properly.  This fixes one part of Bug #2567.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- The MonetDB ODBC driver now no longer depends on its own copy of the
  standard ODBC include files but instead depends on system include
  files (unixODBC on Linux and Microsoft SDK on Windows).

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Changed \d output of mclient no longer to list (internal use only)
  system tables.  Administrator users who like to inspect these tables
  can use SELECT * FROM tables; instead

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Implemented the changes required for properly running ODBC on a
  64-bit platform.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Added stethoscope, a utility to profile MonetDB5 instances,
  originally from the MonetDB5 repository.

* Thu Apr 15 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Documented the database option in the DSN in the Perl interface.
  Also incremented the version number of the Perl interface.
- Fixed a problem in the PHP interface where under certain
  circumstances not all data from the server was read, leading to a
  limited number of rows being returned and other weird behavior.
  This fixes SF bug 2975433.
- If mclient is called with argument -? or --help, exit with exit code
  0.  This fixes SF bug 2956574.

* Wed Feb 17 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed a bug in the Mapi library when sending very large queries to
  the server.
- Implemented BLOB and CLOB support in ODBC driver.

* Tue Feb 02 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed crash upon connect to a server that is under maintenance but
  has the requested language (scenario) not loaded.

* Wed Jan 27 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed bug in the ODBC driver where a non-ASCII character at the end
  of a string caused an error when the string was converted to wide
  characters.

* Wed Jan 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- mclient timer information (-t option) is now written to standard
  error instead of standard output.  This makes getting timer
  information easier when there is a large amount of regular output
  (which can be redirected to a file or /dev/null).

* Tue Jan 19 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Implemented new function mapi_fetch_field_len() which returns the
  length (excluding trailing NULL byte) of the field returned by
  mapi_fetch_field().
