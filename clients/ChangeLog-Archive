* Mon Jul  5 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.3-20100706
- Implemented dumping of GRANT statements.
  This fixes bug 2574.

* Thu Jul  1 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.3-20100706
- Fix implementation of mapi_mapiuri to deal with UNIX socket urls
  properly.  This fixes one part of Bug #2567.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- The MonetDB ODBC driver now no longer depends on its own copy of the
  standard ODBC include files but instead depends on system include
  files (unixODBC on Linux and Microsoft SDK on Windows).

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Changed \d output of mclient no longer to list (internal use only)
  system tables.  Administrator users who like to inspect these tables
  can use SELECT * FROM tables; instead

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Implemented the changes required for properly running ODBC on a
  64-bit platform.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Added stethoscope, a utility to profile MonetDB5 instances,
  originally from the MonetDB5 repository.

* Thu Apr 15 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Documented the database option in the DSN in the Perl interface.
  Also incremented the version number of the Perl interface.
- Fixed a problem in the PHP interface where under certain
  circumstances not all data from the server was read, leading to a
  limited number of rows being returned and other weird behavior.
  This fixes SF bug 2975433.
- If mclient is called with argument -? or --help, exit with exit code
  0.  This fixes SF bug 2956574.

* Wed Feb 17 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed a bug in the Mapi library when sending very large queries to
  the server.
- Implemented BLOB and CLOB support in ODBC driver.

* Tue Feb 02 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed crash upon connect to a server that is under maintenance but
  has the requested language (scenario) not loaded.

* Wed Jan 27 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed bug in the ODBC driver where a non-ASCII character at the end
  of a string caused an error when the string was converted to wide
  characters.

* Wed Jan 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- mclient timer information (-t option) is now written to standard
  error instead of standard output.  This makes getting timer
  information easier when there is a large amount of regular output
  (which can be redirected to a file or /dev/null).

* Tue Jan 19 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Implemented new function mapi_fetch_field_len() which returns the
  length (excluding trailing NULL byte) of the field returned by
  mapi_fetch_field().
