* Thu April 13 2017 Mark Raasveldt <m.raasveldt@cwi.nl>
- Added a new server-side protocol implementation. The new protocol is backwards compatible with the old protocol. Clients can choose whether they want to use the old or the new protocol during the initial handshake with the server. The new protocol is a binary column-based protocol that is significantly faster than the old protocol when transferring large result sets. In addition, the new protocol supports compression using Snappy or LZ4.

- Added 5 new sys schema tables: function_languages, function_types,
  key_types, index_types and privilege_codes.  They are pre-loaded with
  static content and contain descriptive names for the various integer
  type and code values.  See also sql/scripts/51_sys_schema_extension.sql
