- Implemented build directory support for Windows,
  i.e., like on Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate
  build directory as alternative to ...<package>NT, and thus keep the
  latter clean from files generated during the build.
  On Windows, the build directory must be a sibling of ...<package>NT .
