[MonetDBLite](https://www.monetdb.org/blog/monetdblite-r) is a SQL database that runs inside the [R environment for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/) and does not require the installation of any external software. It is similar in functionality to [RSQLite](http://cran.r-project.org/package=RSQLite) and works seamlessly with [the dplyr grammar of data manipulation](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/databases.html), but typically completes queries much faster due to its *columnar* storage architecture and bulk query processing model. MonetDBLite is based on [MonetDB](https://www.monetdb.org/Home).

## Installation

* the latest released version from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=MonetDBLite) with

    ```R
    install.packages("MonetDBLite")
    ````

* the latest development version from github with

    ```R
    devtools::install_github("hannesmuehleisen/MonetDBLite")
    ```

If you encounter a bug, please file a minimal reproducible example on [github](https://github.com/hannesmuehleisen/MonetDBLite/issues). For questions and other discussion, please use [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/monetdblite) with the tag `monetdblite`.  The development version of MonetDBLite endures [sisyphean perpetual testing](http://monetdb.cwi.nl/testweb/web/sisyphus/) on both unix and windows machines.


## Startup

MonetDBLite provides a [`DBI`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=DBI) interface. To startup a server, create a DBI connection as follows:

```R
library(DBI)
dbdir <- tempdir()
con <- dbConnect(MonetDBLite::MonetDBLite(), dbdir)
```

If you want to keep the database around for later, change `dbdir` to point to some meaningful path.

## Data Import

Writing a R `data.frame` into MonetDBLite is efficient, the easiest way of creating a table is through [`dbWriteTable`](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/DBI/docs/dbWriteTable):
```R
dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars)
```

You can also directly import from a CSV by providing a file name instead of a `data.frame` to `dbWriteTable`:
```R
csvfile <- tempfile()
write.csv(mtcars, csvfile, row.names = FALSE)
dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars2", csvfile)
```

The SQL interface of MonetDBLite can also be used to manually create a table and import data:
```R
dbBegin(con)
dbSendQuery(con, "CREATE TABLE mtcars3 (mpg DOUBLE PRECISION, cyl INTEGER, disp DOUBLE PRECISION, hp INTEGER, drat DOUBLE PRECISION, wt DOUBLE PRECISION, qsec DOUBLE PRECISION, vs INTEGER, am INTEGER, gear INTEGER, carb INTEGER)")
dbSendQuery(con, paste0("COPY OFFSET 2 INTO mtcars3 FROM '", csvfile, "' USING DELIMITERS ',','\n','\"' NULL as ''"))
dbCommit(con)
```

Note how we wrap the two commands in a transaction using `dbBegin` and `dbCommit`. This creates all-or-nothing semantics. See the MonetDB documentation for details on [how to create a table](https://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/Manuals/SQLreference/Tables) and [how to perform bulk input](https://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/Manuals/SQLreference/CopyInto).

## Shutdown

MonetDBLite allows multiple concurrent *connections* to a single database, but does not allow more than one concurrent embedded server session (actively-running database). This is not an issue for most users since a single database can store thousands of individual tables.  To switch between databases, however, the first server must be shut down before the second can be opened.  To shutdown a server, include the `shutdown=TRUE` parameter:

```R
dbDisconnect(con, shutdown=TRUE)
```
