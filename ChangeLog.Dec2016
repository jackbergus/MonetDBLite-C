- The Perl, PHP, and Python clients, and the JDBC driver each now have
  their own repositories and release cycles.  The Python client is
  maintained by Gijs Molenaar on Github
  (https://github.com/gijzelaerr/pymonetdb), the other clients are
  maintained by CWI/MonetDB on our own server
  (https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-java,
  https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-perl,
  https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/monetdb-php).
