- Reimplemented summing of a column of floating point (flt and dbl)
  values.  The old code could give wildly inaccurate results when adding
  up lots and lots of values due to lack of precision.  Try SELECT sum(c)
  FROM t; where t is 100,000,000 rows, c is of type REAL and all values
  are equal to 1.1.  (The old code returned 33554432 instead of 1.1e8.)
