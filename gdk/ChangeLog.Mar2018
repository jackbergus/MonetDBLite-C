# ChangeLog file for MonetDB
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Fri Feb 16 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Changed the return type of BATroles from void to gdk_return: it can
  fail due to malloc failure.

* Fri Feb  9 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed functions ALIGNsetH, ALIGNsetT, and CREATEview_ (mind the
  underscore).  The first can easily be replace by using BAThseqbase
  (that's all it did), the second was only used once, and the third can
  be replace by VIEWcreate.

* Thu Jan 18 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed unused functions BATmemsize and BATvmsize.
- Removed the tnodense property: it was maintained but never actually
  used, not even stored.

* Tue Nov  7 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The NIL representation of the internal flt and dbl types was changed
  from the smallest representable finite value to NaN (not-a-number).

* Mon Sep 18 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Changed the interface of ATOMformat and VALformat: they now return a
  pointer to the allocated string.

* Thu Sep 14 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The length "method" for atoms now returns a size_t, the "len" field of
  a ValRecord is now a size_t, the "size" field of the atomDesc structure
  is now unsigned short.
- Removed the "align" field from the ATOM descriptor (atomDesc) structure.
- The atomtostr and atomfromstr "methods" for atoms now return ssize_t
  and require a pointer to size_t for the size of the buffer.
- The atom tostr and fromstr "methods" now always return -1 on error.
  A return value greater than 0 is normal, a return value of 0 is not
  normal, but technically not an error.
