# ChangeLog file for MonetDB

* Tue Jun 28 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- BATs now only have a single (logical) name.
- The function BATmirror is gone.  The HEAD column is always VOID (with
  a non-nil seqbase) and the TAIL column carries the data.  All functions
  that deal with data work on the TAIL column.

- BATkey now works on the TAIL column instead of the HEAD column.
- Replaced BATseqbase with BAThseqbase and BATtseqbase, the former for
  setting the seqbase on the HEAD, the latter for setting the seqbase
  on the TAIL.

* Fri Jun 24 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Replaced function BATnew with COLnew with slightly different arguments:
  the first argument of COLnew is the SEQBASE of the head column (which
  is always VOID).

* Thu May 26 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The "wrd" type has been removed from GDK and MAL.  The type was defined
  to be a 32 bit integer on 32 bit architectures and a 64 bit integer
  on 64 bit architectures.  We now generally use "lng" (always 64 bits)
  where "wrd" was used.
