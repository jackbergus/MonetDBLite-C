- Fixed some problems with BATsample.  It was possible for BATsample to
  return a value that was just beyond the end of the sampled BAT.  Also,
  on some systems the range of the rand() function is rather limited
  (0..32767) and trying to get a sample larger than this range would
  result in an infinite loop.
