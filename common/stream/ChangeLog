- Changed mnstr_settimeout function so that the specified timeout is now
  in milliseconds (used to be seconds), and that it also needs an extra
  argument specifying a callback function (no arguments, int result)
  that should return TRUE if the timeout should cause the function to
  abort or continue what it was doing.
