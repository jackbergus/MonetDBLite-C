# ChangeLog file for sql/src/backends/monet5/merovingian
# This file is updated with mchangelog

* Wed Feb 16 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- The forward property for databases has been removed.  Instead, only
  a global proxy or redirect mode can be set using monetdbd.

* Tue Feb 15 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- monetdbd can no longer log error and normal messages to separate
  logfiles, logging to stdout and stderr is no longer possible either.
- The .merovingian_pass file is no longer in use, and replaced by the
  .merovingian_properties file.  Use monetdbd (get|set) passphrase to
  view/edit the control passphrase.  Existing .merovingian_pass files
  will automatically be migrated upon startup of monetdbd.
- monetdbd now understands commands that allow to create, start, stop,
  get and set properties on a given dbfarm.  This behaviour is intended
  as primary way to start a MonetDB Database Server, on a given location
  of choice.  monetdbd get and set are the replacement of editing the
  monetdb5.conf file (which is no longer in use as of the Apr2011
  release).  See monetdbd(1).
