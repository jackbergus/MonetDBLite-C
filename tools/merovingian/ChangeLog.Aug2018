- Changed the monetdb profilerstart command to be more robust.  If the
  server or stethoscope crashed before, the pid file is still there,
  so the next time we try to start stethoscope, it will fail.  Now the
  profilerstart command will check if a stethoscope process with the
  recorded pid is running. If not, we start stethoscope, assuming that
  something went wrong before.
- Changed the monetdb stop command to try to stop stethoscope before
  stoping the server. The error conditions that can arrise from attempting
  to stop stethoscope are:
  - The database is not running.
  - The profilerlogpath is not set.
  - The profiler.pid file does not exist or is inaccessible.
  - The contents of the profiler.pid are not valid.
  - Shutdown of stethoscope did not succeed.
  - Removing the profiler.pid file failed.
  In all the cases, the attempt to stop the server can continue normally,
  so we actually ignore any errors that rise from the attempt to stop
  stethoscope.
