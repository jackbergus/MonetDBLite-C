- Changed the monetdb stop command to try to stop stethoscope before
  stoping the server. The error conditions that can arrise from attempting
  to stop stethoscope are:
  - The database is not running.
  - The profilerlogpath is not set.
  - The profiler.pid file does not exist or is inaccessible.
  - The contents of the profiler.pid are not valid.
  - Shutdown of stethoscope did not succeed.
  - Removing the profiler.pid file failed.
  In all the cases, the attempt to stop the server can continue normally,
  so we actually ignore any errors that rise from the attempt to stop
  stethoscope.
