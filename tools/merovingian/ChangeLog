# ChangeLog file for sql/src/backends/monet5/merovingian
# This file is updated with mchangelog

* Wed Aug 31 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Starting monetdbd without any arguments or without dbfarm is no longer
  supported.  A dbfarm now must be provided for each command.
- The control passphrase has been turned into a hash of the password, for
  a more stronger authorisation model as used by mclients.  On upgrade,
  any existing passphrase is converted to the hashed version of the
  passphrase.
- The monetdbd controlport option has been removed in favour of a
  boolean control option.  On upgrade, when controlport was set to
  a non-zero value and a passphrase was set, control is set to true,
  or false otherwise.

* Fri Aug 19 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- The monetdbd discoveryport option has been removed in favour of a
  boolean discovery option.  On upgrade, when discoveryport was set to
  a non-zero value, discovery is set to true, or false otherwise.
