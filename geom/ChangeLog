# ChangeLog file for geom
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Fri Feb 26 2016 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The geom module has been completely overhauled.  Types are now specified
  as GEOMETRY(POINT) instead of POINT, old functions have been removed,
  new ones introduced.  However, even with all the changes, a database
  upgrade should still be possible (as always, make a backup first).
