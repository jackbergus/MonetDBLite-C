* Thu Feb  4 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Method getFunctionColumns() in DatabaseMetadata used to throw an
  SQLException:  getFunctionColumns(String, String, String, String) is
  not implemented This method is now implemented and returns a resultset.

* Thu Jan 28 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Method getFunctions() in DatabaseMetadata used to throw an SQLException:
  SELECT: no such column 'functions.sql' This has been corrected. It
  now returns a resultset as requested.
- The resultsets of DatabaseMetadata methods now no longer return a
  value for the *_CAT columns as MonetDB does not support Catalogs.

* Thu Jan  7 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Fixed a memory leak in MonetDatabaseMetaData.java for a static cache
  which kept references to closed Connection objects.
