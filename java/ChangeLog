# ChangeLog file for java
# This file is updated with mchangelog (Gentoo echangelog bastard script)

  09 Oct 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> configure.ag,
  build.properties, build.xml:
  Bump Java source version to 1.5.  Java 1.5 is the current J2EE, and code
  from nl.cwi.monetdb.merovingian relies on Java 1.5 features.  It seems
  like a good time to deprecate 1.4 now 1.6 is about to become the new
  J2EE version.

  Fix configure handling for --enable-{jdbc,xrpc}, by Yue Sheng on
