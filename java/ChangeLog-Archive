* Wed Aug 11 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Implemented ResultSet's getCharacterStream methods, since Hibernate seems to
  call this method for retrieving CLOB columns that we now do support.

* Fri Aug 06 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Fix implementation of setBytes method of PreparedStatement, such that bytes
  are converted to MonetDB/SQL's BLOB notation.

* Wed Jul 21 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- merocontrol Java library requires Java 2 Platform 1.5 and up, due to enum
  and boxing/unboxing. Bug #2627

* Tue Jul 20 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Implement missing Blob support (readonly), since getObject will blindly
  return a BLOB instance as String, which is causing applications to wrongly
  believe a BLOB instance is a string.

* Fri Jul 16 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Fix problem when using the MAL language.  Any statement would return
  an error with a typo that was not typed in by the user, such as
  ioo.printf when io.printf was typed.

* Fri Apr 16 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Jun2010-SP1
- Enable the merovingian control library for default distribution as it
  has been in use for some time without problems now.

* Wed Mar 31 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - Jun2010-SP1
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can now be
  built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".
  Files that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on Windows,
  requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably) requiring a
  rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Wed Mar 31 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010-SP2
- Do not to throw an SQLException, but generate a warning and try to
  perform as much as requested in an optimistic manner, as not to break
  clients that rely on the called method, but don't really use its
  functionality (such as high-level generic programs that call any
  driver and try to put it in a mode that it does what they expect).
  The following functions no longer throw an SQLException but now
  generate a warning and perform actions as far as possible:
  - Statement.execute(sql, columnIndexes/columnNames)
  - Statement.executeUpdate(sql, columnIndexes/columnNames)
  - Statement.getMaxFieldSize()
  - Statement.setCursorName(name)
  - Statement.setEscapeProcessing(enable)
  - Statement.setMaxFieldSize(max)
  - Statement.setQueryTimeout(seconds)
  - PreparedStatement.getMetaData()
  - PreparedStatement.setNull(paramIndex, sqlType, typeName)

* Wed Mar 24 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - Jun2010-SP1
- Implemented build directory support for Windows,
  i.e., like on Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate
  build directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the
  latter clean from files generated during the build.
  On Windows, the build directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Tue Mar 09 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010-SP1
- Set JAVA_HOME to the configure derived value, such that ant will use
  the javac compiler as found by configure, and not the one it was built
  with itself.  This solves the problem that the JDBC driver still fails
  to compile on e.g. Fedora systems even though configure
  --with-java=/path/to/sun/jdk-5 was given, because ant still uses
  gjc/icedtea by itself.

* Mon Oct 12 2009 Wouter Alink <w.alink@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- Bump MCL version to 1.6 for fix.

* Fri Oct 09 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010
- Bump Java source version to 1.5.  Java 1.5 is the current J2EE, and code
  from nl.cwi.monetdb.merovingian relies on Java 1.5 features.  It seems
  like a good time to deprecate 1.4 now 1.6 is about to become the new
  J2EE version.

* Fri Oct 09 2009 Wouter Alink <w.alink@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- applied workaround for bug in Sun JRE 1.6.

* Thu Oct 01 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- Bump JDBC version to 1.14 for fix.

* Thu Oct 01 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- Fix warning messages to disappear when a connection to merovingian is
  made.

* Sun Aug 23 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP1
- Bump JDBC version to 1.13 for fix.

* Sun Aug 23 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP1
- Avoid "ResultSet is closed" messages by disabling the use of
  finalizers, bug #2844202

* Thu Mar 26 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010
- Fix configure handling for --enable-{jdbc,xrpc}, by Yue Sheng on
  Monetdb-developers ML
