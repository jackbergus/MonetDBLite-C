* Sun Jun  9 2013 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.15.9-20130619
- Further improved setBigDecimal() method, based on patch by Ben Reilly
  in bug #3290

* Thu May 23 2013 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.15.9-20130619
- Fixed bug where PreparedStatement.setBigDecimal() wouldn't format its
  input well enough for the server causing odd errors.
- Allow PreparedStatement.setXXX() methods to be called with null
  arguments, bug #3288

* Thu Apr 11 2013 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.15.5-20130412
- The pre-compiled .jar files are now created using Java 7 instead of
  Java 6.

* Sat Dec  1 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.15.1-20130212
- merocontrol was changed to return server URIs, and lastStop time.
  Connections and dbpath were removed.
- Mapi protocol v8 support was removed from MapiSocket.  Protocol
  v8 has not been used by the servers any more since Apr2012 release

* Fri Nov 23 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.13.7-20121212
- Implemented type map support of Connection to allow custom mapping
  of UDTs to Java classes.  By default the INET and URL UDTs are
  now mapped to nl.cwi.monetdb.jdbc.types.{INET,URL}.  Most notably,
  ResultSet.getObject() and PreparedStatement.setObject() deal with the
  type map.

* Thu Nov 22 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@monetdb.org> - 11.13.7-20121212
- Fixed a problem in PreparedStatement where the prepared statement's
  ResultSetMetaData (on its columns to be produced) incorrectly threw
  exceptions about non existing columns.  Bug #3192

* Wed Oct 10 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.13.3-20121016
- Fixed problem with PreparedStatements and setXXX() methods using column
  numbers instead of names, bug #3158

* Tue Aug 14 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.9-20120911
- Fixed a bug where DatabaseMetaData.getURL() did return null:0 for
  hostname:port.

* Fri Jul 20 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.11.7-20120813
- Fixed adaptive cache size used when retrieving results, not to cause
  divide by zero errors when memory gets short, bug #3119.

* Fri Mar  2 2012 Wouter Alink <wouter@spinque.com> - 11.9.1-20120418
- Password reading by JdbcClient no longer results in strange artifacts
- JdbcClient now returns exit code 1 in case of failures

* Tue Feb 28 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.9-20120312
- Implemented missing Number types support in
  PreparedStatement.setObject()

* Mon Feb 20 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.7-20120224
- Fixed bug in DatabaseMetaData.getSchemas() method that caused an SQL
  error when called with catalog and schema argument.

* Tue Feb 14 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.7-20120224
- Resolved a bug where JDBC and Control connections could terminate
  abruptly with 'Connection closed' messages

* Mon Jan  2 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Implemented getMetaData() method of PreparedStatement.

* Tue Dec 27 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Fixed an AssertionError for special results from e.g. EXPLAIN queries.

* Wed Dec 21 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Fixed overflow error when batching large statements, bug #2952

* Tue Dec 20 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Resolved a concurrency problem where ResultSet's date-related getters
  could cause odd stack traces when used by multiple threads at the
  same time, bug #2950.

* Mon Dec 19 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- JDBC now implements JDBCv4.1 which makes it possible to be built with
  Java 7 and up.  JDBCv4.1 is a maintenance release of JDBCv4, and hence
  can be compiled with Java 6, although the added methods obviously are
  not part of the java.sql interfaces.

* Sun Dec 11 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- SQLExceptions thrown now carry a SQLSTATE.  Until the server starts
  sending correct SQLSTATEs for all errors, server originated errors
  without SQLSTATE are considered generic data exceptions (22000).

* Sat Dec 10 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Fixed a bug where closing ResultSets and PreparedStatements could lead
  to errors on concurrent running queries using the same Connection due
  to a race condition.

* Thu Dec  8 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Changed version scheme of JDBC driver and MCL jar to be more standard,
  from monetdb-X.Y-<thing>.jar to monetdb-<thing>-X.Y.jar, bug #2943

* Fri Oct 14 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- The embedded monet instance capability of MonetConnection was removed.
- Bump JDBC version to 2.0 (Liberica).  JDBC now implements JDBCv4 which
  makes it possible to be built with Java 6 and up.  Java 5 and before
  are no longer supported, and can use the 1.x releases of the driver.

* Thu Sep  1 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- INTERVAL columns are now treated as decimals, since they can have
  sub-second precision.

* Thu Jun 30 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Add so_timeout Driver property to specify a SO_TIMEOUT value for the
  socket in use to the database.  Setting this property to a value in
  milliseconds defines the timeout for read calls, which may 'unlock'
  the driver if the server hangs, bug #2828

* Wed May 25 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Added a naive implementation for PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream

* Mon Apr 11 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.5.1-20110907
- The obsolete Java-based implementation for PreparedStatements (formerly
  activated using the java_prepared_statements property) has been dropped

* Fri Jul  8 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.5-20110720
- Return false from Statement.getMoreResults() instead of a
  NullPointerException when no query has been performed on the Statement
  yet, bug #2833

* Mon Jun  6 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.5-20110720
- Fixed read-only interpretation.  Connection.isReadOnly now always
  returns false, setReadOnly now generates a warning when called with
  true.  Partly from bug #2818
- Allow readonly to be set when autocommit is disabled as well.  Bug #2818

* Wed May 11 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.3-20110517
- Insertion via PreparedStatement and retrieval via ResultSet of timestamp
  and time fields with and without timezones was improved to better
  respect timezones, as partly indicated in bug #2781.

* Tue Apr  5 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.1-20110414
- clarify exception messages for unsupported methods

* Mon Feb  7 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.3.1-20110414
- Removed XQuery related XRPC wrapper and XML:DB code, removed support
  for language=xquery and language=mil from JDBC.

* Wed Dec 15 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- PreparedStatements now free the server-side resources attached to them
  when closed.  This implements bug #2720

* Tue Nov  9 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101110
- Fix SQL syntax of inserting BLOB code, using setBytes()
- Added propery 'treat_blob_as_binary' to simulate BINARY types based on
  BLOBs for applications, (e.g. Hibernate-based) that rely on BINARY's
  byte array mapping
- Added code to handle BINARY types
- Fixed implementation of getBytes to match the specifications
- Implemented getBinaryStream according to the specifications

* Mon Nov  8 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101109
- Java 1.6's subSequence() bug has changed into a slice() bug since
  1.6.0_22.  Revert workaround for subSequence breakage, since it breaks
  operating with the latest Java 1.6.

* Fri Oct 22 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.40.1-20101029
- Fix for bug #2703, allow to have multiple metadata ResultSets open at
  the same time

* Wed Aug 11 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Implemented ResultSet's getCharacterStream methods, since Hibernate seems to
  call this method for retrieving CLOB columns that we now do support.

* Fri Aug 06 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Fix implementation of setBytes method of PreparedStatement, such that bytes
  are converted to MonetDB/SQL's BLOB notation.

* Wed Jul 21 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- merocontrol Java library requires Java 2 Platform 1.5 and up, due to enum
  and boxing/unboxing. Bug #2627

* Tue Jul 20 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Implement missing Blob support (readonly), since getObject will blindly
  return a BLOB instance as String, which is causing applications to wrongly
  believe a BLOB instance is a string.

* Fri Jul 16 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Fix problem when using the MAL language.  Any statement would return
  an error with a typo that was not typed in by the user, such as
  ioo.printf when io.printf was typed.

* Fri Apr 16 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Jun2010-SP1
- Enable the merovingian control library for default distribution as it
  has been in use for some time without problems now.

* Wed Mar 31 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - Jun2010-SP1
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can now be
  built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".
  Files that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on Windows,
  requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably) requiring a
  rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Wed Mar 31 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010-SP2
- Do not to throw an SQLException, but generate a warning and try to
  perform as much as requested in an optimistic manner, as not to break
  clients that rely on the called method, but don't really use its
  functionality (such as high-level generic programs that call any
  driver and try to put it in a mode that it does what they expect).
  The following functions no longer throw an SQLException but now
  generate a warning and perform actions as far as possible:
  - Statement.execute(sql, columnIndexes/columnNames)
  - Statement.executeUpdate(sql, columnIndexes/columnNames)
  - Statement.getMaxFieldSize()
  - Statement.setCursorName(name)
  - Statement.setEscapeProcessing(enable)
  - Statement.setMaxFieldSize(max)
  - Statement.setQueryTimeout(seconds)
  - PreparedStatement.getMetaData()
  - PreparedStatement.setNull(paramIndex, sqlType, typeName)

* Wed Mar 24 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - Jun2010-SP1
- Implemented build directory support for Windows,
  i.e., like on Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate
  build directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the
  latter clean from files generated during the build.
  On Windows, the build directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Tue Mar 09 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010-SP1
- Set JAVA_HOME to the configure derived value, such that ant will use
  the javac compiler as found by configure, and not the one it was built
  with itself.  This solves the problem that the JDBC driver still fails
  to compile on e.g. Fedora systems even though configure
  --with-java=/path/to/sun/jdk-5 was given, because ant still uses
  gjc/icedtea by itself.

* Mon Oct 12 2009 Wouter Alink <w.alink@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- Bump MCL version to 1.6 for fix.

* Fri Oct 09 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010
- Bump Java source version to 1.5.  Java 1.5 is the current J2EE, and code
  from nl.cwi.monetdb.merovingian relies on Java 1.5 features.  It seems
  like a good time to deprecate 1.4 now 1.6 is about to become the new
  J2EE version.

* Fri Oct 09 2009 Wouter Alink <w.alink@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- applied workaround for bug in Sun JRE 1.6.

* Thu Oct 01 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- Bump JDBC version to 1.14 for fix.

* Thu Oct 01 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP2
- Fix warning messages to disappear when a connection to merovingian is
  made.

* Sun Aug 23 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP1
- Bump JDBC version to 1.13 for fix.

* Sun Aug 23 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Aug2009-SP1
- Avoid "ResultSet is closed" messages by disabling the use of
  finalizers, bug #2844202

* Thu Mar 26 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - Feb2010
- Fix configure handling for --enable-{jdbc,xrpc}, by Yue Sheng on
  Monetdb-developers ML
