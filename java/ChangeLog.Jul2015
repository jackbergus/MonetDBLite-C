# ChangeLog file for java
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu May 12 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Improved JdbcClient program when presenting query data to console.
  It used to send an SQL catalog query for each query result column
  which slowed down the interactive response considerably.
  These additonal SQL catalog queries have been eliminated.

* Thu May 12 2016 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Corrected MonetResultSet.getObject(String columnName). It no longer
  throws a NullPointerException in cases where internally a
  MonetVirtualResultSet is used.

* Sun May  8 2016 Jennie Zhang <y.zhang@cwi.nl>
- Fixed Connection.isValid(): this method should never attempt to
  close the connection, even if an error has occurred.
