/**
 * The MCLServer is the actual interface to a server process talking to
 * an MCL client.  It takes care of the MCL specific actions such as
 * dereferencing values and sending result sets in parts.  It functions
 * as useful abstraction that allows to retrieve the next MCLMessage
 * that is meant for the server process and send one or more responses
 * to this MCLMessage.
 * <br /><br />
 * The use of this class can schematically be represented like this:
 * <pre>
 *                 getNextMessage()
 *                       |
 *                       V
 *                 startResponse()
 *                       |
 *               isBatch V
 * +-- batchMessage() ---O
