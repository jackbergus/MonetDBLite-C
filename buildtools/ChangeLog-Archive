* Sat Aug  6 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Fixed Fedora 15 (and presumably later) configuration that uses a tmpfs
  file system for /var/run.  This fixes bug 2850.

* Wed Jul 20 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- The default OID size for 64-bit Windows is now 64 bits.  Databases with
  32 bit OIDs are converted automatically.

* Wed Jul 13 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- We can now build RPMs on CentOS 6.0.  Since there is no geos library
  on CentOS, we do not support the geom modules there.

* Wed Jun 29 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- We can now also build on Fedora 15.  This required some very minor
  changes.
- Changed configure check for OpenSSL so that we can also build on CentOS
  5.6.  We now no longer demand that OpenSSL is at least version 0.9.8f,
  but instead we require that the hash functions we need are supported.

* Thu Jul 22 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.0-20100823
- Changed Maddlog to search up the directory tree to find a ChangeLog
  file.

* Wed Mar 31 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.0-20100823
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Wed Mar 24 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.0-20100823
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .
