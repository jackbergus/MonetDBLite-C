This is a modified version of Burg.

The following modifications have been made to ease the
development of the Pathfinder XQuery compiler project:

 -- Added printing of `#line' tags in the generated C code. 
    (Eases development process with some development tools.)

 -- Made documentation LaTeX2e compliant.

 -- Integrated Burg into the Pathfinder build setup.  The
    Makefile is now created via autogen/automake/autoconf.
    The original Makefile is available in the file
    `Makefile.orig'.

 -- Made Grammar file gram.y bison-compliant: Removed `='
    characters.

 -- Several minor changes to make Burg compile on modern
    (and restrictive) compilers. (Added function declarations,
    #includes, etc.)

The original source code of Burg is available via the site
http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/. Please do not
report bugs related to this modified version to the original
burg developer, Todd A. Proebsting, but to the Pathfinder
development team at pathfinder@inf.uni-konstanz.de.
