To build, run
	python setup.py build
then to install, run
	python setup.py install [--prefix=<install-dir-prefix>]

Use
	python setup.py --help
to get more information about the possible options.

If you use the --prefix option or otherwise install autogen in a
different place, you may have to set your PYTHONPATH environment
variable accordingly.  The directory which needs to be added is
<install-dir-prefix>/lib/python<python-version>/site-packages, where
<python-version is the version of Python used (e.g. 2.4).

On Windows, to follow these instructions, Python must of course be
found in your PATH.  The default location where autogen.py is
installed is the Scripts subdirectory of the Python tree
(i.e. C:\Python24\Scripts if you have installed Python 2.4 in the
default location).  Make sure this folder is in your PATH when
building MonetDB and the other packages.
