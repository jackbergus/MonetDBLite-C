To build, run
	python setup.py build
then to install, run
	python setup.py install [--prefix=<install-dir-prefix>]

Use
	python setup.py --help
to get more information about the possible options.

If you use the --prefix option or otherwise install autogen in a
different place, you may have to set your PYTHONPATH environment
variable accordingly.  The directory which needs to be added is
<install-dir-prefix>/lib(64)/python<python-version>/site-packages, where
<python-version> is the version of Python used (e.g. 2.4).
You can automatically get the respective directory via
"<install-dir-prefix>/`python -c 'import distutils.sysconfig; print distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib(0,0,"")'`".
(
In case your are using Apple-built Python 2.5.1 on Mac OS X 10.5.1 (Darwin 9.1.0),
it can be that the above command yields
"<install-dir-prefix>/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages", 
while Python's distutils.core.setup() actually installs the python modules into
"<install-dir-prefix>/lib/python2.5/site-packages".
In that case, replacing the above command by 
"<install-dir-prefix>/`python -c 'import distutils.sysconfig; print distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib(0,1,"")'`/site-packages"
might help to overcome this inconsistency.
)

On Windows, to follow these instructions, Python must of course be
found in your PATH.  The default location where autogen.py is
installed is the Scripts subdirectory of the Python tree
(i.e. C:\Python24\Scripts if you have installed Python 2.4 in the
default location).  Make sure this folder is in your PATH when
building MonetDB and the other packages.
