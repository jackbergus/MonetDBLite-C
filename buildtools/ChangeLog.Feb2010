# ChangeLog file for buildtools
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Fri May  7 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>

  --email and --fullname options have disappeared as we can relibably
  get them from Mercurial now.

* Thu Dec  6 2007 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Implemented rudimentary conditional support for ant targets

* Wed Dec  5 2007 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Allow for 'included' dependencies, such that the wonders of libtool
  can compile against a build dir of a dependency, instead of its
  installation dir.

* Tue Jan  9 2007 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Initial autotooled setup
