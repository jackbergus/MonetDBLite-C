The Mx documentation tool enables the programmer to keep source code
and documentation in a single file.  Thus once the program is finished
the documentation of the program is also written.  The use of a text
formatter enables the programmer to express more clearly properties of
the program.

To compile, first run the script
	./bootstrap
then do the usual sequence,
	./configure [--prefix=<install-dir-prefix>]
	make
	make install

Use
	./configure --help
to find out the options you can give to configure.

On Windows using the Microsoft compiler, you can just type
	nmake -f Makefile.msc

If you use this way of building Mx, and your buildtools directory is
on the same level as MonetDB (i.e. a sibling directory), you don't
need to change the MonetDB configuration.
