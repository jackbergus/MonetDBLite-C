# ChangeLog file for buildtools
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed Jun 29 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- We can now also build on Fedora 15.  This required some very minor
  changes.
- Changed configure check for OpenSSL so that we can also build on CentOS
  5.6.  We now no longer demand that OpenSSL is at least version 0.9.8f,
  but instead we require that the hash functions we need are supported.
