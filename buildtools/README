This directory contains tools that are needed to build (parts of) the
MonetDB suite.

Mx - The tool to extract sources and documentation from .mx files.
mel - The MonetDB Extension Language tool.
autogen - A tool to create Makefiles from Makefile.ag.
burg - A tool to help produce parsers (only used in pathfinder).

Mx is needed by many other packages and doesn't itself depend on
anything else, so build Mx first.

To build the various tools in one go (not on Windows with the
Micorsoft tools, see below), simply first run the script
	./bootstrap
then do the usual sequence,
	./configure [--prefix=<install-dir-prefix>]
	make
	make install
(Note: We require GNU make, which might be called "gmake" on some systems.)

To build the various tools in one go on Windows using the Microsoft
compiler, simply run
	nmake /f Makefile.msc
in a cmd window.
Note that compiling burg using the Microsoft tools is not supported.

To build the various tools individually (except for autogen), change into
the tool's directory, and execute the command
	./bootstrap
This command will call the various autoconf/automake etc. tools in the
correct order to build a configure script.  Then decide where you want
to build the tool (it can be in the directory itself, but also in some
other directory), change to that location and call configure from the
source directory.  Finally, run "make" and "make install".

The tool directories all have a file README with instructions for that
tool, including how to compile on Windows.

In particular, see autogen/README for how to set your PYTHONPATH in case
./bootstrap of MonetDB, sql, pathfinder, etc. fails to find the autogen
module with the default settings.
