# ChangeLog file for buildtools
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Fri Jul  7 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The Windows installers (*.msi files) are now created using the WiX
  Toolset.
- The Windows binaries are now built using Visual Studio 2015.  Because of
  this, you may need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual
  Studio 2015 before being able to run MonetDB.
