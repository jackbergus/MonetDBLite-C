Description: database system for high-performance applications, libraries
 MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
 main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
 automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
 accelerators, SQL- and XML- frontends.
 .
 This package contains the core components of MonetDB in the form of a
 single shared library.  If you want to use MonetDB, you will certainly
 need this package, but you will also need one of the server packages.
