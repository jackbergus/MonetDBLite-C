 MonetDB is a database management system that is developed from a
 main-memory perspective with use of a fully decomposed storage model,
 automatic index management, extensibility of data types and search
 accelerators, SQL- and XML- frontends.

 This package contains the programs and files needed for testing the
 MonetDB packages.  You probably don't need this, unless you are a
 developer.
