enabled "top-level" Mtest.py

So far, while Mtest.py could be called in any subdirectory of the MonetDB
source tree (and could then run all tests in the entire sub-tree),
it was not possible to call Mtest.py in the top-level MonetDB source
directory to run all tests.  Instead, to run all tests, Mtest.py had to
be called at least 4 times, once in each of these directories: "clients",
"monetdb5", "sql", "geom".

Now, it is possible to call Mtest.py once in the top-level MonetDB source
directory to run all tests in one go.

The behaviour of calling Mtest.py in any subdirectory, including the
four mentioned above, did not changed, other than that now obsolete
command line options "-p / --package <package>" and "-5 / --monetdb5"
have been removed.
