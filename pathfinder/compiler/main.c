 * @mainpage Pathfinder XQuery Compiler Project
 *
 * @section procedure Compilation Procedure
 *
 * @subsection scanning Lexical Scanning
 *
 * Lexical scanning of the input query is done with a
 * <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/">flex</a> generated
 * scanner. The implementation in parser/XQuery.l follows the appendix of
 * the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-20041029/">October 2004</a>
 * working draft of the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3 Consortium</a>.
 * The scanner dissects the input query into lexical tokens that serve
 * as an input for the @ref parsing "Parser".
 *
 * @subsection parsing Parsing
 *
 * In the parsing phase, the input query is analyzed according to the
 * XQuery grammar rules. The parser is implemented with 
 * <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">bison</a> (see
 * file parser/XQuery.y). The implementation closely follows the grammar
 * described in the
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-20041029/">October 2004</a>
 * working draft of the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3 Consortium</a>.
 *
 * The output of the parser is an abstract syntax tree (aka ``parse tree'')
 * that represents the input query in memory in a form that is very close
 * to the input syntax. Declarations of the abstract syntax tree and
 * helper functions to access and modify the tree are to be found in
 * parser/abssyn.h.
 *
 * @subsection modules XQuery Module Support
 *
 * During parsing, we keep a work list of modules that have been
 * referenced via "import module" (array @c modules in parser.y).
 * In PFparse_modules() (ran after query parsing) we process this work
 * list and load any modules referenced in the query. We might encounter
 * new "import module" statements as we do that, and we simply add them
 * to the work list. Keeping the work list unique avoids endless loops
 * in case of cyclic imports.
 *
 * @subsection abssyn_norm Normalization of the Abstract Syntax Tree
 *
 * Semantically equivalent queries can result in different abstract
 * syntax trees, e.g., when parentheses are introduced, etc. In a
 * normalization phase that follows query parsing, we get rid of these
 * ambiguities and make sure that semantically equivalent queries result
 * in the same parse tree.
 *
 * <b>An example for a normalization rule:</b>
 *
 * Using parentheses, nested @c exprseq nodes can be created in the
 * abstract syntax tree. They are semantically equivalent to right deep
 * chains of @c exprseq nodes. Thus,
 @verbatim
 exprseq (exprseq (a, b), exprseq (c, nil))
 @endverbatim
 * is rewritten to
 @verbatim
 exprseq (a, exprseq (b, exprseq (c, nil)))
 @endverbatim
 *
 * Abstract syntax normalization is done with a BURG based pattern matcher.
 *
 * The BURG input file for the abstract syntax tree normalization is
 * normalize.brg, located in the semantics subdirectory. After processing
 * it with @c BURG, the pattern matcher is generated as C code.
 *
 * @subsection ns Namespace Resolution
 *
 * The compiler then checks that the given query uses XML
 * Namespaces (NS) correctly.  In a qualified name (QName) @c ns:loc,
 * it is mandatory that the NS prefix @c ns is in scope, according to
 * the W3C XQuery and W3C XML Namespace rules.
 *
 * For each such successful NS test, if the NS prefix @c ns has been
 * mapped to the URI @c uri, this phase attaches @c uri to the QName
 * in question.  After this phase has completed, a QName either uses
 * no NS at all or carries the complete @c ns @c |-> @c uri mapping
 * with it.
 *
 * All XQuery NS-relevant prolog declarations, NS scoping rules, and
 * NS declaration attributes of the form @c xmlns="uri" and @c
 * xmlns:ns="uri" (such NS decl attributes are removed after they have
 * been processed) are understood.
 *
 * NS resolution is implemented in semantics/ns.c.  Include
 * semantics/ns.h if you need access to NS specific data structures
 * and operations only, include semantics/nsres.c if you need to
 * access the actual NS resolution function (this should be needed in
 * main.c, only).
 *
 * @subsection varscoping Variable Scope Checking
 *
 * Namespace resolution is followed by a scope-checking phase that
 * checks variable declaration and usages. Scoping rules are verified and
 * to each variable a unique memory block is assigned that contains all
 * required information about this variable. Multiple references to the
 * same variable result in references to the same memory block, following
 * the XQuery scoping rules.
 *
 * Variable scoping is implemented in semantics/varscope.c. In
 * pathfinder/variable.c access and helper functions around variables are
 * implemented.
 *
 * @subsection fun_check Checking for Correct Function Usage
 *
 * Similar to checking the variable scoping rules, correct usage of
 * functions is checked in a next phase. Valid functions are either
 * built-in functions or user-defined functions (defined in the query
 * prolog with ``<code>declare function</code>''). Function usage is
 * checked in PFfun_check() (file semantics/functions.c). We maintain
 * an environment of visible functions (#PFfun_env).  This environment
 * holds function descriptors (#PFfun_t). Before traversing the whole
 * abstract syntax tree, this array is filled with (a) built-in
 * functions and (b) user-defined functions.
 *
 * The built-in XQuery Functions & Operators (XQuery F&O) are registered
 * with the function environment in semantics/xquery_fo.c.
 *
 * User-defined functions are discovered by a tree-walk through the
 * subtree below the <code>query prolog</code> node. The function
 * descriptor contains information like the name of the function, as
 * well as its parameter and return types. When all functions are
 * registered in the array, the whole abstract syntax tree is
 * traversed, searching for #p_fun_ref nodes. For each of these, the
 * function is looked up in the array. If it is found, the semantic
 * information in the current node is replaced by a pointer to the
 * #PFfun_t struct containing the information for the function to call
 * here. Otherwise, an error is reported.
 *
 * @subsection fs XQuery Formal Semantics (Compilation to Core Language)
 *
 * The abstract syntax tree used in the previous processing steps very
 * closely represents the surface syntax of XQuery. For internal
 * query optimization and evaluation steps, however, we use another,
 * more suitable query representation, called <em>Core</em>. Although
 * very similar to the XML Query surface language, Core is missing some
 * ``syntactic sugar'' and makes many implicit semantics (i.e., implicit
 * casting rules) more explicit.
 *
 * Our Core language is very close to the proposal by the W3C, described
 * in the XQuery Formal Semantics document. Core is the data structure
 * on which the subsequent type inference and type checking phases will
 * operate on. Internally, Core is described by a tree structure
 * consisting of #PFcnode_t nodes. Core compilation is implemented
 * with help of a BURG pattern matcher in fs.brg.
 *
 * @subsection core_simplification Core Simplification and Normalization
 *
 * The Formal Semantics compilation sometimes produces unnecessarily
 * complex Core code. The simplification phase in @c simplify.brg
 * simplifies some of these cases and normalizes the Core language tree.
 *
 * @subsection type_inference Type Inference and Check
 *
 * Type inference walks the core expression, inferring a type for each
 * node.  Types are attached to the core tree nodes to facilitate type
 * checking.
 * 
 * PFty_check() decorates the core tree with type annotations but
 * lets the tree alone otherwise (almost).
 *
 * @subsection coreopt Core Language Optimization
 *
 * The Core language tree is now labeled with static type information,
 * allowing for various optimizations and rewrites of the tree. This
 * is done in @c coreopt.brg.
 *
 * <b>Example:</b>
 *
 * @verbatim
     typeswitch $v
       case node return e1
       default   return e2
@endverbatim
 *
 * If we can statically decide that the type of <code>$v</code> is
 * @em always a subtype of @c node (e.g. if it is the result of an
 * XPath expression), we may replace the whole expression by expression
 * @c e1. Conversely, we can replace the expression by @c e2, if we
 * know that the type of <code>$v</code> can @em never be a subtype
 * of @c node (the static type of <code>$v</code> and the type @c node
 * are @em disjoint).
 *
 * @subsection core2alg Compiling Core to a Logical Relational Algebra
 *
 * Pathfinder compiles XQuery expressions for execution on a relational
 * backend (MonetDB). The heart of the compiler is thus the compilation
 * from XQuery Core to a language over relational data, i.e., a purely
 * relational algebra. This compilation is done in @c core2alg.brg.
 *
 * The compilation follows the ideas described in the paper presented
 * at the TDM'04 workshop (``Relational Algebra: Mother Tongue---XQuery:
 * Fluent'', <a href='http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/~teubner/publications/algebra-mapping.pdf'>http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/~teubner/publications/algebra-mapping.pdf</a>).
 * The result of this compilation phase is an algebra expression (in
 * an internal tree representation, as described by @c algebra.c). The
 * algebra is an almost standard relational algebra, with some operations
 * made very explicit (e.g., no higher order functions). Few extensions,
 * such as the staircase join operation, are added for tree-specific
 * operations.
 *
 * @subsection algebra_cse Algebra Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)
 * 
 * The algebra code generated in the previous step contains @em many
 * redundancies. To avoid re-computation of the same expression, the
 * code in algebra_cse.c rewrites the algebra expression @em tree into
 * an equivalent @em graph (DAG), with identical subexpressions only
 * appearing once.
 *
 * @subsection algopt Logical Algebra Optimization
 *
 * The generated algebra code is another, maybe the most important,
 * hook for optimizations. The (twig based) code in @c algopt.mt does
 * some of them (e.g., removal of statically empty expressions).
 *
 * @subsection physalg Compilation into Physical Algebra
 *
 * Order is one of the fundamental concepts in XQuery. It thus turns
 * out that the consideration of order can significantly help to
 * optimize query plans.
 *
 * We thus translate the logical algebra tree into a physical algebra.
 * This physical algebra makes several logical operators more explicit
 * (e.g., different implementations for a single logical operator, or
 * the separation of sorting and numbering for the rownum operator).
 *
 * Compilation into the physical algebra happens in algebra/planner.c.
 * The planner derives costs for physical algebra subexpression trees
 * and keeps track of properties like orderedness. The best plan is
 * derived using a dynamic programming approach: For each subexpression,
 * we keep a set of ``best'' plans, where a plan is a ``best'' plan if
 * there's no other plan that provides the same ordering at a lower cost.
 *
 * The ordering framework is implemented in algebra/ordering.c. Note
 * that we do not (yet) implement the notion of ordering that is
 * mentioned in our technical review, but only a ``simple'' lexical
 * ordering. The planner also considers properties on the logical
 * algebra tree, like the information on constant columns. These
 * properties are maintained via algebra/properties.c.
 *
 * We do not yet have a real cost model for our physical algebra.
 * Instead, each physical algebra operator in algebra/physical.c
 * derives some cost value in a rather naive way. This is okay for
 * the current state of our algebraic optimizer, but we should really
 * implement a real cost model.
 *
 * For details on the algebra stuff, please refer to the
 * @ref compilation page (algebra/algebra.c).
 *
 * @subsection milgen Compilation into a MIL tree
 *
 * MIL is Pathfinder's target language. The code in mil/milgen.brg
 * translates a physical algebra tree into MIL. We do not, however,
 * directly generate a serialized MIl program, but assemble an 
 * internal MIL syntax tree first. This MIL tree is serialized to
 * ``real'' MIL afterwards in mil/milprint.c. This serializer
 * follows some grammar that we define on our MIL trees, which at
 * the same time validates the structure of the MIL tree during
 * serialization.
 *
 *
 * @section commandline Command Line Switches
 *
 * @subsection treeprinting Tree Printing
 *
 * Tree data structures are used in several situations within this project.
 * To make these in-memory structures visible for debugging purposes, we
 * use the help of the tree drawing tool ``dot'' from
 * <a href="http://www.att.com">AT&T's</a>
 * <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">graphviz</a>
 * package. The tree structure is printed in a syntax understandable by
 * dot. By piping Pathfinder's output to dot, the tree can be represented
 * as PostScript or whatever. ``dot'' output is selected by the command
 * line option <code>-D</code>. (In the example, `<code>-p</code>'
 * requests to print the <code>a</code>bstract syntax tree in dot notation.)
 @verbatim
 $ echo 'doc("foo.xml")/foo/bar' | ./pf -Das6 | dot -Tps -o foo.ps
 @endverbatim
 * See the dot manpage for more information about dot.
 *
 * @subsection prettyprinting Prettyprinting
 *
 * Output in human readable form is done with the help of a prettyprinting
 * algorithm. The output should be suitable to be viewed on a 80 character
 * wide ASCII terminal. Prettyprinted output can be selected with the
 * command line option <code>-P</code>:
 @verbatim
 $ echo 'doc("foo.xml")/foo/bar' | ./pf -Pcs13
 @endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection what_to_print Data Structures that may be Printed
 *
 * The command line switches <code>-a</code>, <code>-c</code>, 
 * <code>-l</code>, and <code>-p</code> request printing of abstract
 * syntax tree (aka. parse tree), Core language tree, logical and
 * physical algebra expression tree, respectively.
 *
 * @subsubsection print_formatting Configuring the dot output
 *
 * Logical and physical algebra trees are annotated with various
 * additional properties.  As displaying all of them would blow
 * the graphical tree output, printing of these annotations can
 * be enabled separately.  For this, add a command line option
 * <tt>-f</tt> (<tt>--format</tt>), followed by a format string.
 * Each character in this format string will trigger the respective
 * annotation to be printed in the dot output (if applicable):
 *
 *  - @c C (capital @c C): Print cost values in physical trees.
 *
 *  - @c c (lower-case @c c): List constant attributes in logical
 *    and physical trees.
 *
 *  - @c o (lower-case @c o): List orderings guaranteed for each
 *    physical tree node.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @verbatim
      echo 'for $i in (1,2) return $i + 1' | ./pf -ADps17 -f Co | dot -Tps
@endverbatim
 * will print the physical algebra tree in dot format, annotated with
 * information on cost values and on orderings provided by each
 * sub-expression.
 *
 * @subsection stopping Stopping Processing at a Certain Point
 *
 * For debugging it may be interesting to stop the compiler at a
 * certain point of processing. The compiler will stop at that point
 * and will print out tree structures as requested by other switches.
 *
 * You find all the stop points listed by issuing the command line
 * help (option <code>-H</code>). The following example stops processing
 * after mapping the abstract syntax tree to Core and prints the
 * resulting Core tree:
 * @verbatim
 $ echo 'doc("foo.xml")/foo/bar' | ./pf -Pcs10
@endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection types Static typing for the core language
 *
 * Pathfinder performs static type checking for the generated XQuery
 * core programs.  Passing <code>-t</code> to Pathfinder lets the
 * compiler print type annotations (in braces <code>{ }</code>) along
 * with core program output.
 *
 * @verbatim
 $ echo 'doc("foo.xml")/foo/bar' | ./pf -Pcts13
@endverbatim
