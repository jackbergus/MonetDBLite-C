         8  after valid function usage has been checked
         9  after XML Schema predefined types have been loaded
        10  after XML Schema document has been imported (if any)
        11  after the abstract syntax tree has been mapped to Core
        12  after the Core tree has been simplified/normalized
        13  after type inference and checking
        14  after XQuery Core optimization
        15  after the Core tree has been translated to the logical algebra
