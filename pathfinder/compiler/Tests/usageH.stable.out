Pathfinder XQuery Compiler ($Revision$, $Date$)
(c) University of Konstanz, DBIS group

Usage: pf [OPTION] [FILE]

  Reads from standard input if FILE is omitted.

= -h, --help: print short help message
= -H, --fullhelp: print this help message for advanced options
= -q, --quiet: do not print informational messages to log file
= -d[N], --debug: print debug information (default level=1)
= -A, --enable-algebra: turn on internal algebra code.
        Don't use this, it WILL break.
= -M, --print-mil_summer: print MIL code (summer version) (default)
= -P, --print-human-readable: print internal tree structure human-readable
= -D, --print-att-dot: print internal tree structure in AT&T dot notation
= -T, --timing: print elapsed times for compiler phases
= -O[0-3], --optimize: select optimization level (default=1)
= -t, --typing: print static types (in {...}) for Core
= -s, --stop-after: stop processing after certain phase:
         1  right after input parsing
         2  after loading XQuery modules
         3  after parse/abstract syntax tree has been normalized
         4  after namespaces have been checked and resolved
         5  after variable scoping has been checked
         6  after XQuery built-in functions have been loaded
         7  after valid function usage has been checked
         8  after XML Schema predefined types have been loaded
         9  after XML Schema document has been imported (if any)
        10  after the abstract syntax tree has been mapped to Core
        11  after the Core tree has been simplified/normalized
        12  after type inference and checking
        13  after XQuery Core optimization
        14  after the Core tree has been translated to the logical algebra
        15  after the logical algebra tree has been rewritten/optimized
        16  after the CSE on the logical algebra tree
        17  after compiling logical into the physical algebra
        18  after compiling the physical algebra into MIL code
        19  after the MIL program has been serialized
= -a, --print-abstract-syntax-tree: print abstract syntax tree
= -c, --print-core-tree: print internal Core language
= -l, --print-logical-algebra: print logical algebra tree
= -p, --print-physical-algebra: print physical algebra tree
= -f format, --format=format: print optional information in algebra dot output:
         C  print cost value (physical algebra)
         c  print constant attributes (logical/physical algebra)
         o  print orderings (physical algebra)

Enjoy.
