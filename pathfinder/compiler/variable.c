 * @file
 * Access functions for variable information structs.
 *
 * For every variable, a PFvar_t struct is created. The struct currently
 * contains the variable name, but may later contain more information
 * about the variable (e.g., type information, etc.). Several occurencies
 * of the same variable reference the same PFvar_t struct, the pointer
 * serves as a unique identifier of each variable. Variables that have
 * the same name but are distinct variables according to scoping rules
 * result in distinct PFvar_t structs.
