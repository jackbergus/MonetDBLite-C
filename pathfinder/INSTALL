REQUIREMENTS
============

  The following tools are required to compile and install the Pathfinder
  XQuery compiler:

   -- flex (the scanner generator)
      Version 2.5.4 works fine

   -- bison (the parser generator)
      Version 1.33 works fine. Pathfinder (currently) requires the
      `locations' feature of current bison versions.

   -- m4 (the GNU macro processor)
      Version 1.4 works fine; should be present on most systems.

   -- sed (the the stream editor)
      GNU sed version 3.02 works fine here, but most other versions
      should also do.

   -- A C compiler, of course
      The GNU C compiler gcc works fine with versions 2.95 and 3.3.
      If you experience problems with other compilers, please let us
      know.

   -- MonetDB (the MonetDB main-memory database system)
      Pathfinder is quite tightly coupled to the MonetDB database system.
      It depends on a version that is at least 4.15.0.


  Some libraries are used or even required by the Pathfinder compiler:

   -- The libxml2 XML parsing library.
      This library is required for
       (a) the XML Schema import feature of the Pathfinder compiler, and
       (b) for the XML document loader (runtime/shredder.mx).
      If libxml2 is not available on your system, the Pathfinder compiler
      will be compiled without XML Schema support. The XML document loader
      will not be compiled at all in that case.
      You get libxml2 with any current Linux distribution or at
      http://www.xmlsoft.org


INSTALLATION
============

Simple Installation
-------------------

The most simple way to install the Pathfinder system on your machine is

 1. `cd' to the directory containing the Pathfinder sources and type
    `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

 2. Type `make' to compile the package.

 3. Type `make install' to install the package on your system.

The Pathfinder compiler `pf' will be installed into /usr/local/bin on
your system.


Customized Installation
-----------------------

The `./configure' script supports the usual command line switches to
modify the target directories Pathfinder will be installed in:

  --prefix=DIR        Use DIR as the prefix for all files to install instead
                      of /usr/local.

(A list of more command line options to modify installation directories
is printed by `./configure --help'.)

The `./configure' script also provides command line switches to specify
the location of required libraries on your system:

  --with-libxml2=DIR     Prefix of your libxml2 installation. The (shared)
                         libraries are expected to be in DIR/lib. The
                         header file parser.h is expected to be in
                         DIR/include/libxml2/libxml. If you don't want
                         to use libxml2, give `--without-libxml2' on the
                         command line (see the consequences above).


Installation from Development Sources
-------------------------------------

The development sources do not contain the `./configure' script, but
sources for the auto... tools to produce it. The script `./bootstrap'
contains all the commands to produce the `./configure' script, as
well as the other required files (`Makefile.in', `config.h.in', etc.).

The sources work fine with autoconf 2.57 and automake 1.75.

After running `./bootstrap' proceed as in a regular installation as
described above (`./configure ; make ; make install').


Enjoy.
