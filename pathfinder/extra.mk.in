# extra make rules for Pathfinder

#
# -c 1000 makes burg abort if costs exceed 1000. This essentially
#         detects recursion in burg rules and avoids infinite loops
#         at build time (or segfaults).
# -d      reports some statistics and reports on unused rules and
#         terminals. (Please look at this output when making
#         Pathfinder if you have modified any burg files. Unused
#         rules indicate errors in your grammar!)
# -I      makes burg emit standard code for some burg internal functions.
#         (Otherwise we'd have to provide them ourselves.)
# -p...   adds a prefix to each burg internal function. We base this
#         prefix on the file name to avoid linker problems (as we use
#         burg allover Pathfinder).

# If Burg fails, it will still produce some output. If somebody
# invoked `make' again compilation would produce strange results
# with these corrupt .c files. We thus advise `make' to delete
# them on error.
