# ChangeLog file for devel

* Thu Apr 13 2017 Mark Raasveldt <m.raasveldt@cwi.nl>
- Added a new server-side protocol implementation. The new protocol
  is backwards compatible with the old protocol. Clients can choose
  whether they want to use the old or the new protocol during the initial
  handshake with the server. The new protocol is a binary column-based
  protocol that is significantly faster than the old protocol when
  transferring large result sets. In addition, the new protocol supports
  compression using Snappy or LZ4.

  static content and contain descriptive names for the various integer
  type and code values.  See also sql/scripts/51_sys_schema_extension.sql
