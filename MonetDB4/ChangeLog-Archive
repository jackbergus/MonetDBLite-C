* Tue Aug 24 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 4.38.5-20100824
- Fixed a crash when calculating certain aggregates on platforms where
  non-aligned data access is not allowed (e.g. Sparc).

* Thu Jul 22 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 4.38.5-20100823
- Slight change to Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu installers: the database
  directory now has the group setuid bit set so that new databases
  inherit the group ownership (monetdb).

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 4.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 4.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 4.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .
