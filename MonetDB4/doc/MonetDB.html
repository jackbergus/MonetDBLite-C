<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The technical documentation is spread over a number of topics.
The command line tools are 
<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Tools/Mserver/index.html">Mserver</a> 
and 
<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Tools/MapiClient/index.html">MapiClient</a>,
which can be used to establish a session.
</p>
<p>
The topics covered in <a href="#Kernel">Kernel</a> are mostly
detailed technical descriptions of the MonetDB kernel;
<a href="#APIs">APIs</a> contains an overview of the available application programming
interfaces, and <a href="#Modules">Modules</a> 
contains detailed descriptions of the database kernel extensions.
The guides provides details on the SQL front-end and facilities
handle XML in MonetDB.

<a name="Kernel"><h3>Kernel</h3></a>
<p>
The technical documentation of MonetDB  is mainly geared 
at application developers
and those interested in the inner working of the system. 
The starting point for getting acquainted with the system is to
read the <a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Core/monet/index.html">architecture overview</a>.
Although it is rather technically oriented, it creates a general understanding
of its design and inner working.
</p>
<p>
The User Guide of the Monet Interpreter Language (<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/FrontEnds/mil/index.html">MIL</a>) 
explains the algebraic interface of the Monet back-end. 
Front-ends like the SQL front-end translate high
level query languages to MIL. 
This document is  a must if you plan
to develop your own front-end, or need low-level access to the MonetDB server.
An overview of the architecture and features of the 
<a href="http://monetdb.cwi.nl/TechDocs/FrontEnds/SQL/index.html">SQL front-end</a> 
is described separately.
Tutorials on SQL syntax and semantics are abundantly available on the web
and thus not included here.
</p>
<p>
The Monet Extension Language (<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Core/mel/index.html">MEL</a>)
is a specification language for creating <em>extension modules</em> that add new 
algebra-operators and atomic 
types to MIL. Implementations should be provided separately in C/C++.  
<br>
The utility that parses MEL specifications and generates <em>glue code</em> is
also called <a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Core/mel/mel-tool/index.html">mel</a>.
</p>
<p>
Extension programmers are advised to first study the technical documentation
of the very <a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Core/gdk/index.html">kernel</a>
to get acquainted with the most important internal data structures and APIs.
More technical information about MonetDB is available on our 
<a href="http://monetdb.cwi.nl/Research/index.html">website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Much of this documentation is integrated with the MonetDB
code using the <em>literate programming</em> tool 
<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Core/Mx/index.html">Mx</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="APIs"><h3>APIs</h3></a>
<p>
The application programmer's interfaces (APIs) have been developed with
a keen eye on what currently prevails in the database community.
The native client-server interface of MonetDB is called 
<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/Core/Modules/mapi/index.html">Mapi</a> (MonetDB API).
Internally, it is used to implement all other APIs. 
Mapi is language neutral, it can both be used for MIL and SQL querying. 
<br>
There are language bindings for (among others)
<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/APIs/Mapi/C/index.html">C</a>
and
<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/APIs/Mapi/Java/Documentation/index.html">Java</a>.
</p>

<a name="Modules"><h3>Modules</h3></a>
<p>
Monet is an extensible system. It obtains its functionality from a large
collection of extension modules.
They have been developed over the years to cover our need in experiments.
Construction of a module requires intimate knowledge of the internals
of MonetDB. Creation of a new module should only be considered if
the current set has a serious functional limitation, or if a particular
application the performance requirements can not be met by SQL or MIL.
</p>
<p>  The modules can be dynamically loaded (and dropped) during a session,
but often it makes more sense to load the module set as part of a session
initialization action. Each client has its own set of modules.
</p>
<p>
<a href="MonetDB/TechDocs/FrontEnds/mil/index.html#mod_5_0_0">The modules</a>
 can be roughly grouped as follows. The <em> algebra, bat, builtin</em>
contain the binary algebra primitives. 
The <em> arith, mmath, decimal</em> modules provide various forms of scalar processing.
The user defined types supported are <em>blob, decimal, enum, monettime</em>.
The primitives to support datamining applications, e.g. cross-table construction
and advanced group-based statistics, are covered by <em>aggr, aggrX3, xtables</em>.
Support for performance monitoring is included in <em>counters, pcl, calib</em>
