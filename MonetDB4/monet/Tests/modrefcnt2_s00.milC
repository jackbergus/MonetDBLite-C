# First client does not load module "lock" him/herself;
# hence, it should 
# a) either see both module "lock" and its atom "lock",
#    as they were loaded in the global context,
#    and hence succeed to print BAT test;
# b) or see neither of them,
#    as they were not loaded in this client,
#    and hence fail to print BAT test.
# 
# According to Peter Boncz, "b" is the desired behavior.
# 
# Currently, however, the client sees the module "lock",
# but fails to print BAT test as it contains the 
# 'illegal type' "lock"...

# should not show module "lock":
loaded();

# should all fail:
sigs("lock");
bat("test").print();
bat("test").count().print();
