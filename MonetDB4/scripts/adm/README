Usage convertBBP.sh:

Persistent bats in an old database (old being
before patch gdk_bbp.dir revision 1.23.4.2
on 2001/09/15) "disappear" automatically...
unless you run this script before using them
with a recent Monet.

Yet, you should only use it once, only
on old databases, and before using the new
Monet with those old databases.

The script expects as parameter the location
of your databases, like gdk_dbfarm in MonetDB.conf.

(NOTE: Applying the script to a newly created bat
in a new monet will make it un-destroyable - 
unless you revert the fix by decreasing the
plevel count to 1).

Usage findtmpbats.pl:

If the database crashes or something else problematic 
happens, temporary bats may exist on disk that do not occur
in the BBP any more.
While this is being fixed, this workaround perl script removes
bat files that are not listed in the BBP, possibly
regaining lots of disk space (just ask Alex).
