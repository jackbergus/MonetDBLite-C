This directory (MonetDB4/tests) contains several suites (see below) of
tests for Monet that are not (yet) assigned to one of the source or module
directories. See testing/README for further details concerning testing.

test suites in this directory:

- Availability:	testing the availability of modules and their MIL commands

- BugReports:	test scripts extracted from bug reports

- sigs:		old version of Availability

- suite_??:	older (partly outdated) test scripts

- FIX.suite_??:	same as suite_??, but with out performance output, so output
		should be identical on any system
