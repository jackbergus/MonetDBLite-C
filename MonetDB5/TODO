*MonetDB 5.8 (Jan 2008)
  23 Jul 2006; Martin Kersten <mlkersten>; OPEN
  The X100 subsystem with its buffer manager and
  compression scheme is integrated in the software stack.

*MonetDB 5.6 (Sep 2007)

  23 Jul 2006; Martin Kersten <mlkersten>; OPEN
  XQuery/XUpdate is ported to MonetDB Version 5 using
  Pathfinder compiler and algebraic optimizer.
  The main bottleneck is the translation of the MIL 
  procedures into MAL.

*MonetDB 5.4 (May 2007)

*MonetDB 5.2 (Jan 2007)

  23 Jul 2006; Romulo Concalves <romulog>; OPEN
  The system supports remote materialized SQL views
  with an efficinet push/pull update strategy.
  The MAL plans are translated by an optimizer into
  local/remote calls, minimizing the amount of data
  traffic.

*MonetDB 5.0 (Sep 2006)

  23 Jul 2006; Martin Kersten <mlkersten>; OPEN
  The program mclient uses a history file, named
  .mapiclient_history, which lives in the home
  directory of the user. Readline commands can be
  used to browse and re-use it.

  23 Jul 2006; Fabian Groffen <mr-meltdown>; OPEN
  Client programs can access any MonetDB server at
  the target site and will be re-directed to the
  server in charge of managing the database of interest.

  Miscellaneous stuff, to be sorted out.
  We limit BAT* operation as much as possible to :void headed versions
  All unsafe signatures should be tagged to facilitate flow analysis
  BBP should become a fully serialized module, encapsulation with a single lock
  (this calls for check for IO triggered activities inside BBP)
  All BATs should be considered private unless otherwise marked (add BATshared())
  ATOMcmp should not walk the storage field, this should be
  made explicit if needed.
  Make sure BAT producing operations leave them as readonly behind

  Naming conventions get/set properties
  [ht]operation convention or operation[ht]_[ht]

  BATs entered into a box should become persistent? (tst1004,1005,1014)
  Use a process buffer pool to avoid expensive client starts.
  Let modules define theire throwable exceptions, which
  are included in the caller environment.
