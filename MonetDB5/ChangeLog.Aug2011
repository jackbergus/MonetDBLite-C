- Fixed a problem where MAL variables weren't properly cleared before
  reuse of the data strucutre.  This problem could cause the data flow
  scheduler to generate dependencies between instructions that didn't
  actually exist, which in turn could cause circular dependencies among
  instructions with deadlock as a result.  Bugs 2865 and 2888.
