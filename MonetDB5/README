The MonetDB Database System
===========================

The MonetDB database is developed by the CWI database research group 
(see http://monetdb.cwi.nl).

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open source,
where it is accessible at http://sourceforge.net/projects/monetdb

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB kernel works together with an
SQL frontend that is in a separate CVS module.

If you got a source distribution, please compile and install MonetDB first,
following the instructions in the file '../MonetDB/HowToStart.rst' (for Unix)
or '../buildtools/doc/windowsbuild.rst' (for Windows).

The documentation starts in doc/MonetDB.html, relative from your binary
distribution top-level directory, or installation directory (once you
compiled and installed the source distribution).
