/*
 * Running all eligible instructions in parallel creates
 * resource contention. This means we should implement
 * an admission control scheme where threads are temporarily
 * postponed if the claim for memory exceeds a threshold
 * In general such contentions will be hard to predict,
 * because they depend on the algorithm, the input sizes,
 * concurrent use of the same variables, and the output produced.
 *
 * One heuristic is based on calculating the storage footprint
 * of the operands and assuming it preferrably should fit in memory.
 * Ofcourse, there may be intermediate structures being
 * used and the size of the result is not a priori known.
 * For this, we use a high watermark on the amount of
 * physical memory we pre-allocate for the claims.
 *
 * Instructions are eligible to be executed when the
 * total footprint of all concurrent executions stays below
 * the high-watermark or it is the single expensive
 * instruction being started.
 *
 * When we run out of memory, the instruction is delayed.
 * How long depends on the other instructions to free up
 * resources. The current policy simple takes a local
 * decision by delaying the instruction based on its
 * past and the size of the memory pool size.
 * The waiting penalty decreases with each step to ensure
 * it will ultimately taken into execution, with possibly
 * all resource contention effects.
 *
 * Another option would be to maintain a priority queue of
 * suspended instructions.

 * A consequence of multiple threads is that they may claim more

 * In many cases this situation will be temporary, because
 * threads will ultimately release resources.
 * Therefore, we wait for it.
 *
 * Alternatively, a front-end can set the flow administration
 * program counter to -1, which leads to a soft abort.
 * [UNFORTUNATELY this approach does not (yet) work
 * because there seem to a possibility of a deadlock
 * between incref and bbptrim. Furthermore, we have
 * to be assured that the partial executed instruction
 * does not lead to ref-count errors.]
 *
 * The worker produces a result which will potentially unblock
 * instructions. This it can find itself without the help of the scheduler
 * and without the need for a lock. (does it?, parallel workers?)
 * It could also give preference to an instruction that eats away the object
 * just produced. THis way it need not be saved on disk for a long time.
