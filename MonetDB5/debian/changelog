monetdb5-server (5.18.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * The MonetDB 5 code base underwent a series of small/medium changes:
    - Solving name conflicts with external libraries in mal_box.
    - Dependency graph generation in MAL debugger fixed.
    - Code hardening against out of memory errors and based on Coverity checks.
    - Recycler improved to deal with SQL plans from different sessions.
    - Profiler extended to report the argument types, user, and thread id.
    - MAL interpreter reports an event before and after the instruction.
    - Dataflow also allowed for updates on temporary BATs.
    - Reorder optimizer better respects the dataflow.
    - All update instructions return their target to mark the dataflow.
    - Clean up of (bat)calc module.
    - Packing pieces together simplified and speed up.
  * The MAL interpreter has been extended with an operator admission scheme, which is
    active during parallel execution. It blocks threads if the total amount of memory
    needed for the operator can not be claimed. Only if there is one operation
    left to execute, it won't block. The admission level is controlled by
    a threshold, which is set to 90% of the physical memory.

  * The ilike[u]select operations has been included in the repertoire
    recognized by the mergetable optimizer for push through of selections.
  * The joinpath optimizer has been extended with recognition of the leftjoin.
    This way, series of leftjoin operations can be optimized by looking at
    the smallest starting point.
  * Introduced a dictionary encoding option to the optimizer pipeline.
    Encoding is initiated with a SQL call compress(tablename).

monetdb5-server (5.18.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the ability to redirect to other running databases in the same
    dbfarm.  This functionality has been taken over completely by
    merovingian, and only results in confusement these days, bug #2891191.
  * Added --enable-console configure argument, defaulting to 'yes' for
    now.  Disabling the server console increases security by avoiding
    local access exploits.  This is not the default since our Testing
    setup cannot deal with a console-less server yet.
