@- Stack Reduction
The compilers producing MAL may generate an abundance of temporary variables
to hold the result of expressions. This leads to a polution of the
runtime stack space, because space should be allocated and garbage
collection tests should be performed.


The routine @sc{optimizer.reduce()} reduces the number of scratch
variables to a minimum. All scratch variables of the same underlying
type share the storage space. 
The result of this optimizer can be seen using the MonetDB debugger,
which marks unused variables explicitly.
Experience with the SQL front-end shows, that this optimization
step easily reduces the stack consumption by over 20%.

This optimizer needs further testing. 
Furthermore, the other optimizers should be careful in setting
the isused property, or this property can again be easily derived.
