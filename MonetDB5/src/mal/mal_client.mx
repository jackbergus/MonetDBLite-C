Clients gain access to the Monet server through a internet connection
or through its server console.
Access through the internet requires a client program at the
source, which addresses the default port of a running server.
The functionality of the server console is limited.
It is a textual interface for expert use.

@ifset M5manual
At the server side, each client is represented by a session record with the
current status, such as name, file descriptors, namespace, and local stack.
Each client session has a dedicated thread of control, which limits
the number of concurrent users to the thread management facilities of the
underlying operating system. A large client base should be supported using
a single server-side client thread, geared at providing
a particular service.

The number of clients permitted concurrent access is 
a compile time option. The console is the first and is always present.
It reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
@end ifset

Client sessions remain in existence until the corresponding
communication channels break or its retention timer expires
The administrator and owner of a sesssion
can manipulate the timeout with a system call.

@ifset sqlmanual
There are many user-friendly tools to interact with a SQL database server.
A few based on the JDBC library of MonetDB are included for reference only.
@end ifset
@{
Client records are linked into a hierarchy, where the top record
denotes the context of the Monet administrator. The next layer
is formed by a database administrator and the third layer contains
user sessions.
This hierachy is used to share and constrain resources, such
as global variables or references to catalogue information.
During parallel execution additional layers may be constructed.
[This feature needs more implementation support]

The prompt structure is designed to simplify recognition
of the language framework for interaction. For direct console
access it is a short printable ascii string. For access through
an API we assume the prompt is an ascii string surrounded by a \001
character. This simplifies recognition.
The information between the prompt brackets can be used to
pass the mode to the front-end. Moreover, the prompt can be
dropped if a single stream of information is expected from the
server(See mal_profiler.mx).

The user can request server-side compilation as part of the 
initialization string. See the documentation on Scenarios.

The actions for a client is separated into several stages: parsing,
strategic optimization, tactial optimization, and execution. 
The routines to handle them are obtained once the scenario is choosen.
Each stage carries a state descriptor, but they share the IO state
description. A backup structure is provided
to temporarily switch to another scenario. Propagation of the state
information should be dealt with separately.[TODO]

Keeping track of instructions executed is a valueable tool for
script processing and debugging. 
Its default value is defined in the MonetDB configuration file.
It can be changed at runtime for individual clients using
the operation @sc{clients.listing}(@emph{mask}).
A listing bit controls the level of detail to be generated during
program execution tracing. The lowest level (1) simply dumps the input,
(2) also demonstrates the MAL internal structur (4) adds the 
type information

In interactive mode, reading one line at a time, we should be
aware of parsing compound structures, such as functions and
barrier blocks. The level of nesting is maintained in blkmode,
which is reset to zero upon encountering an end instruction,
or the closing bracket has been detected. Once the complete
structure has been parsed the program can be checked and executed.
Nesting is indicated using a '+' before the prompt.

any pervasive debugger command. For detailed information

Each client has a private entry point into the namespace and

A client record is initialized upon acceptance of a connection.
The client runs in his own thread of control until it finds a
soft-termination request mode (FINISHING) or its IO file
descriptors are closed. The latter generates an IO error, which
leads to a safe termination.

The system administrator client runs in the primary thread of
control to simplify debugging with external debuggers.

A new Client structure can only be requested if the 'adm'
user is available, because it guarantees a way to deliver
ny error message.
Searching a free client record is encapsulated in
a critical section to hand them out one-at-a-time.
Marking them as being claimed avoids any interference from parallel
actions to obtain client records.

You can always retrieve a client record using the thread identifier,
because we maintain a 1-1 mapping between client and thread of control.
Therefore, we don't need locks either.
If the number of clients becomes too large, we have to change the 
allocation and lookup scheme.

Finding a client record is tricky when we are spawning threads 
as co-workers. It is currently passed as an argument.

@- Client decendants
Forking is a relatively cheap way to create a new client.
The new client record shares the IO descriptors.
To avoid interference, we limit children to only produce 
output by closing the input-side.

If the father itself is a temporary client, let 
the new child depend on the grandfather.
@c
Client MCforkClient(Client father){
	Client son = NULL;
	if( father == NULL) return NULL;
	if (father->father != NULL) father = father->father;

		/* reuse the scopes wherever possible */

When a client needs to be terminated then the file descriptors for
its input/output are simply closed. 
This leads to a graceful degradation, but may take some time
when the client is busy.
A more forcefull method is to kill the client thread, but this
may leave locks and semaphores in an undesirable state.

The routine freeClient ends a single client session,
but through side effects of sharing IO descriptors,
also its children. Conversely, a child can not close a parent.

@-
If a client disappears from the scene (eof on stream), we should
terminate all its children. This is in principle a forcefull action,
because the children may be ignoring the primary IO streams.
(Instead they may be blocked in an infinite loop)

Special care should be taken by closing the 'adm' thread.
It is permitted to leave only when it is the sole user of the system.

Furthermore, once we enter closeClient, the process in which it is
raised has already lost its file descriptors.

@+ Client input
Input to be processed is collected in a Client specific buffer.
It is filled by reading information from a stream, a terminal,
or by scheduling strings constructed internally. 
The latter involves removing any escape character needed to 
manipulate the string within the kernel.
The buffer space is automatically expanded to accommodate new 
information and the read pointers are adjusted.
@-
The input is read from a (blocked) stream and stored in the client record
input buffer. The storage area grows automatically upon need.
The origin of the input stream depends on the connectivity mode.

Most interactions should be regulated through the Mclient
front-end. This will also take care of buffering a request before
submission. This avoids a significant number of network interactions.

@{
@-
Each operation received from a front-end consists of at least one line.
To simplify misaligned communication with front-ends, we use different
prompts structures. [think, can we avoid acks]

@-
The default action is to read information from an ascii-stream
one line at a time. This is the preferred mode for reading
from terminal.
@-
The next statement block is to be read. Send a prompt to warn
the front-end to issue the request.
