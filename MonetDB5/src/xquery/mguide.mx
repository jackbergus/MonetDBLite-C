@+ MonetDB Guide Library
The MonetDB Guide library provides the routines to manage
and inspect the data guide.

@mal
module mguide;

command open(nme:str):oid
address MGtobedefined
comment "Locate the guide associated with a named document. 
	Return its document id.";

command new(nme:str):oid
address MGtobedefined
comment "Introduce a new data guide and creates the root. 
	The document id is returned for future reference.";

command add(id:oid, path:str, edge:bat[:oid,:any_1])
address MGtobedefined
comment "If path='/a' then the document id is matched with each oid in edge.
	If path='/a/b' then the edge represents the step a/b.";


command descendant(id:oid, E:bat[:oid,:any_1], F:str, T:str):bat[:oid,:any_2]
address MGtobedefined
comment "F and T denote walks in the guide, such that F is
a proper prefix of T. The routine initiates a sequence of joins starting
with the head of E to find the last edge in T.";

command ancestor(id:oid, E:bat[:oid,:any_1], F:str, T:str):bat[:oid,:any_2]
address MGtobedefined
comment "F and T denote ancestor walks in the guide, such that T is
a proper prefix of F. The routine initiates a sequence of joins starting

command link(id:oid, E:bat[:oid,:any_1], F:str, T:str):bat[:oid,:any_2]
address MGtobedefined
comment "F and T denote walks in the guide. The target is to link
the head of E with the tail object in T. Or conversely, use E as the target
of the last object in T, i.e. walking the ancestor trail.";
