The Mx macro below is used in many places throughout the code base to
access the BAT descriptor.

@= getBATdescriptor
	if( (@3= BATdescriptor(*@2)) == NULL ){ *@1 = 0;
		 return throwMessage("@4", "cannot access descriptor @2");
   }
@= Pseudo
	if (BBPindex("@1_@2_@3") <= 0)
		BATname(b, "@1_@2_@3");
	BATroles(b,"@1","@2");
	BATmode(b,TRANSIENT);
	BATfakeCommit(b);
	*ret = b->batCacheid;
	BBPkeepref(*ret);
