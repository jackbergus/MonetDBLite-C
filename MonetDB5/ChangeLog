- The MAL interpreter has been extended with an operation
  admission policy to control the memory claims of all
  concurrent running interpreters. Instructions are hold
  up unto there is sufficient resource or the query plan
  can not avoid its execution anymore.
- The join path optimizer has been extended with searching for
  join*, semijoin*, and leftjoin* paths. Furthermore, it avoids
  duplicate work by factoring out all common simple join paths.
