# ChangeLog file for MonetDB5
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed Oct  3 2012 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl>
- The scheduler of mserver5 was changed to use a fixed set of workers to
  perform the work for all connected clients.  Previously, each client
  connection had its own set of workers, easily causing resource problems
  upon multiple connections to the server.
