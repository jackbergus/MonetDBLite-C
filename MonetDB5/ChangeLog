# ChangeLog file for MonetDB5
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Sun Jan 10 2010 Martin Kersten <mk@>
- Introduced a dictionary encoding option to the optimizer pipeline.
  Encoding is initiated with a SQL call compress(tablename).

* Sun Nov 15 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Removed the ability to redirect to other running databases in the same
  dbfarm.  This functionality has been taken over completely by
  merovingian, and only results in confusement these days, bug #2891191.
- Added --enable-console configure argument, defaulting to 'yes' for
  now.  Disabling the server console increases security by avoiding
  local access exploits.  This is not the default since our Testing
  setup cannot deal with a console-less server yet.

* Tue Nov  3 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Report detected amount of main memory and cpu cores in output of
  `mserver5 --version`.
