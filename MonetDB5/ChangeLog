  15 Nov 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> configure.ag,
  src/tools/mserver5.mx:
  Added --enable-console configure argument, defaulting to 'yes' for
  now.  Disabling the server console increases security by avoiding
  local access exploits.  This is not the default since our Testing
  setup cannot deal with a console-less server yet.

  03 Nov 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
  src/tools/monet_version.c.in:
  Report detected amount of main memory and cpu cores in output of
  `mserver5 --version`.
