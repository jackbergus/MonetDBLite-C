# Predefined code segment
#The compiler can not guarantee an accurate compilation,
#because MIL unlike MAL is a dynamically typed language.
#A few guidelines to maximize usefullness.
#- make the type of variables explicit, in particular 'nil'
#- upon advice of M2m to remap identifiers, change it in your program directly
#var test2 := new(int,int);
	test2 := new(:int,:int);
#test2.insert(2,2);
	aa_a := insert(test2,2,2);
