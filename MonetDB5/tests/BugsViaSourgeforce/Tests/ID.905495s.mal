# Monet Mil to Mal compiler
# Copyright (c) 2001-2004, CWI. All rights reserved.

# Predefined code segment
#The compiler can not guarantee an accurate compilation,
#because MIL unlike MAL is a dynamically typed language.
#A few guidelines to maximize usefullness.
#- make the type of variables explicit, in particular 'nil'
#- upon advice of M2m to remap identifiers, change it in your program directly
#print("hello");
	aa_a := io.print("hello");
