The file manual.texi contains the integrated documentation
framework for the MonetDB Version 5 product family.

The files sqlmanual.texi (and later m5manual.texi, xquery.texi)
are subsets of the framework. They share sections.
Pieces in the shared code can be filtered out using
the texi flags 'SQLmanual' and 'M5manual'.
