<h2 class="chapter">9 Boxed variables</h2>

<p>Clients sessions often come with a global scope of variable settings. 
Access to these global variables should be easy,
but they should also provide protection against concurrent update
when the client wishes to perform parallel processing. 
Likewise, databases, query languages, etc. may define constants and variables
accessible, e.g. relational schemas, to a selected user group.

   <p>The approach taken is to rely on persistent object spaces
as pioniered in Lynda and -later- JavaSpaces. 
They are called boxes in MonetDB and act as managed containers
for persistent variables.

   <p>Before a client program  can interact with a box, it
should open it, passing qualifying authorization
information and parameters to instruct the box-manager
of the intended use. A built-in box is implicitly
opened when you request for its service.

   <p>At the end of a session, the box should be closed. Some box-managers
may implement a lease-scheme to automatically close interaction
with a client when the lease runs out. Likewise, the box can
be notified when the last reference to a leased object
ceases to exist.

   <p>A box can be extended with a new object using the function
deposit(name) with name a local variable. 
The default implementation silently accepts any new definition of the box. 
If the variable was known already in the box, its value is overwritten.

   <p>A local copy of an object can be obtained using the
pattern 'take(name,[param])', where name denotes the variable
of interest. The type of the receiving variable should
match the one known for the object. Whether an actual
copy is produced or a reference to a shared object
is returned is defined by the box manager.

   <p>The object is given back to the box manager calling 'release(name)'. 
It may update the content of the repository accordingly, release locks,
and move the value to persistent store. Whatever the semantics
of the box requires. [The default implementation is a no-op]

   <p>Finally, the object manager can be requested to 'discard(name)'
a variable completely.  The default implementation is to reclaim
the space in the box.

   <p>Concurrency control, replication services, as well as access
to remote stores may be delegated to a box manager. 
Depending on the intended semantics, the box manager
may keep track of the clients holding links to this members,
provide a traditional 2-phase
locking scheme, optimistic control, or check-out/check-in scheme. 
In all cases, these management issues are transparant to the
main thread (=client) of control, which operates on a temporary
snapshot. For the time being we realize the managers as critical
code sections, i.e. one client is permitted access to the box space
at a time.

   <p>Example: consider the client function:
<pre class="example">     function myfcn():void;
     	b:bat[:oid,:int] := bbp.take("mytable");
     	c:bat[:int,:str] := sql.take("person","age");
     	d:= intersect(b,c);
     	io.print(d);
     	u:str:= client.take(user);
     	io.print(u);
     	client.release(user);
     end function;
</pre>
   <p>The function binds to a copy from the local persistent BAT space,
much like bat-names are resolved in earlier versions. The second
statement uses an implementation of take that searches a variable
of interest using two string properties. It illustrates that
a box manager is free to extend/overload the predefined scheme,
which is geared towards storing MAL variables.

   <p>The result bat 'c' is temporary and disappears upon garbage
collection. The variable 'u' is looked up as the string object user.

   <p>Note that BATs b and c need be released at some point. In general
this point in time does not coincide with a computational boundary
like a function return. During a session, several bats may be taken
out of the box, being processed, and only at the end of a session
being released. In this example, it means that the reference to
b and c is lost at the end of the function (due to garbarge collection)
and that subsequent use requires another take() call. 
The box manager bbp is notified of the implicit release and
can take garbage collection actions.

   <p>The box may be inspected at several times during a scenario run. 
The first time is when the MAL program is type-checked for the
box operations. Typechecking a take() function is tricky. 
If the argument is a string literal, the box can be queried
directly for the objects' type. 
If found, its type is matched against the lhs variable. 
This strategy fails in the situation when at
runtime the object is subsequently replaced by another
typed-instance in the box. We assume this not to happen and
the exceptions it raises a valuable advice to reconsider
the programming style.

   <p>The type indicator for the destination variable should be
provided to proceed with proper type checking. 
It can resolve overloaded function selection.

   <p>Inspection of the Box can be encoded using an iterator at the MAL
layer and relying on the functionality of the box. 
However, to improve introspection, we assume that all box
implementations provide a few rudimentary functions, called objects(arglist)
and dir(arglist). The function objects() produces a BAT with
the object names, possibly limited to those identified by
the arglist.

<h3 class="section">9.1 Future</h3>

<p>The world of boxes has not been explored deeply yet. 
It is envisioned that it could play a role to import/export
different objects, e.g. 
introduce xml.take() which converts an XML document to a BAT,
jpeg.take() similer for an image.

   <p>Nesting boxes (like Russian dolls) is possible. It provides a simple
containment scheme between boxes, but in general will interfere with
the semantics of each box.

   <p>Each box has [should] have an access control list, which names
the users having permission to read/write its content. 
The first one to create the box becomes the owner. He may grant/revoke
access to the box to users on a selective basis.

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.1 Session box</h4>

<p>Aside from box associated with the modules, a session box is created
dynamically on behalf of each client. Such boxes are considered private
and require access by the user name (and password). 
At the end of a session they are closed, which means that they are
saved in persistent store until the next session starts. 
For example:
<pre class="example">     function m():void;
     	box.open("client_name");
     	box.deposit("client_name","pi",3.417:flt);
     	f:flt := box.take("client_name","pi");
     	io.print(t);
     	box.close("client_name");
     end function;
</pre>
   <p>In the namespace it is placed subordinate to any space introduced by the
system administrator. It will contain global client data, e.g. 
user, language, database, port, and any other session parameter. 
The boxes are all collected in the context of the database directory,
i.e. the directory &lt;dbfarm&gt;/box

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.2 Garbage collection</h4>

<p>The key objects managed by MonetDB are the persistent BATs, which
call for an efficient scheme to make them accessible for manipulation
in the MAL procedures taking into account a possibly hostile
parallel access.

   <p>Most kernel routines produce BATs as a result, which will be referenced
from the runtime stack. They should be garbage collected as soon as
deemed possible to free-up space. By default, temporary results are
garbage collected before returning from a MAL function.

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.3 Polymorphic globals</h4>

<p>The top level interaction keeps a 'box' with global variables,
i.e. each MAL statement is interpreted in an already initialized
stack frame. 
This causes the following problems: 1) how to get rid of global variables
and 2) how to deal with variables that can take 'any' type. 
It is illustrated as follows:
<pre class="example">     f:= mil.take("GT");
     io.print(f);
</pre>
   <p>When executed in the context of a function, the answer will be
simple [ 1 ]. The variable type need not be defined, because
the print operation can handle any type using the concrete
type associated with f on the stack.

   <p>However, when executed interactively, statement by statement,
the answer printed will be [ 0 ]. The reason is that both
statements are converted into a function and executed independently. 
Between function calls the variables are reset, i.e. temporary
variables are removed and others are re-initialized. [check]
