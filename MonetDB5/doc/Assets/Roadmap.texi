@subsection SQL Implementation Roadmap
In this section we summarize the SQL features scheduled for implementation
and those that won;t be supported in the foreseeable future.
A precise timeline can not be given. It depends too much on the
available resources and urgency.

Our current assessment of the features planned for upcoming releases,
in order of priority, are:
@itemize
@item
Text retrieval support.
@item 
Stored SQL procedures.
@item
Support for multi-media objects.
@item
General column and table constraint enforcement.
@item
Internationalization of the character sets.
@item
Full outer-join queries.
@item
Triggers.
@end itemize

@subsection Features that won;t make it.
The database backend architecture prohibits easy implementation of
several SQL-99 features. Those on the list below are not expected to
be supported.
@itemize
@item
Cursor based processing, because the execution engine is not based
on the iterator model deployed in other engines. A simulation of the
cursor based scheme would be utterly expensive from a performance
point of view.
@item
Multi-level transaction isolation levels. Coarse grain isolation is
provided using table level locks.
@end itemize
