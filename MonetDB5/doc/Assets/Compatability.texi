@section Backward compatibility

The MonetDB software runs back to the early nineties and
users have based their business
critical applications on the platform since the mid-nineties.
This long history creates
a challenge in a research laboratory setting to find an evolutionary
software development track. Fortunately, the core development team
is still at CWI and is dedicated to maintain the software base.
Of course, within the confines of limited resources available
and in balance with the primary research activities.

The development of Version 5 was driven by the following 
compatibility requirements:
@itemize @bullet
@item The programming interface technology (ODBC, JDBC, Mapi)
are all retained to reduce impact on external applications.
@item SQL and XQuery should compile directly on both old and new versions. 
@item The MIL language is depreciated, but MIL programs can
mostly be converted to the MAL language.
@item The kernel library GDK remains the primary execution engine.
@item The key extension modules to the GDK kernel
are mostly carried over without change.
