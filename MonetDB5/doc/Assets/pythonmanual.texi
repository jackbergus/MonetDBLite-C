@section MonetDB Python Library
The MonetDB distribution comes with 
a @url{"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/",Python DB-API} driver.
This is build on top of the MAPI interface for Python.

@subsection Installation
The unix configure process normally tries to detect if you have python 
including developer packages installed and builds the python module 
only if you have it. With the @emph{--with-python} option you 
could tell 'configure' where to find the python installation.

When the build process is complete you should have a python library 
directory under your MonetDB prefix directory. Usually this 
is @emph{prefix/lib/python2.4/site-packages}.
Now add this directory to your PYTHONPATH.

For windows setups the story is a little bit more complex.

@subsection A Simple Python Example
A small example to access the SQL functionality is shown below.
@verbatim
import MonetSQLdb

# Let the cursor return dictionaries instead of tuples:
# x = MonetSQLdb.connect(cursorclass = MonetSQLdb.cursors.DictCursor)

x = MonetSQLdb.connect(host = 'localhost', user = 'monetdb',
                       password = 'monetdb', lang = 'sql')

c = x.cursor()
c.execute('select * from tables')

print c.fetchone()
# print c.fetchall()

x.close()
@end verbatim
