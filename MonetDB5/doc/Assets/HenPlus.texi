@subsection HenPlus
@url{http://henplus.sourceforge.net/, HenPlus} is a SQL shell written in
Java that works for any database that offers JDBC support. So basically
any database. Why do we need this?  Any database comes with some shell,
but all of them have missing features (and several shells are simply
unusable). And if you work with several databases at once (if you are a
developer, then you do this all the time), switching between these tools
is tedious.
Using HenPlus with MonetDB requires two things: 1) to adjust the
@code{CLASSPATH} variable, such that it contains the
monetdb-1.x-jdbc.jar file, and 2) to register the MonetDB JDBC driver
within HenPlus.

Registering within HenPlus is done by just running HenPlus without any
options.  On the HenPlus prompt type: @code{register MonetDB
nl.cwi.monetdb.jdbc.MonetDriver jdbc:monetdb://localhost/database}.  To
connect to MonetDB after registering the driver, start HenPlus as
follows: @code{henplus jdbc:monetdb//localhost/database}.  It is
important to keep the @code{CLASSPATH} environment variable pointing to
the MonetDB JDBC driver, or HenPlus will not be able to find it.
