@section MonetDB PHP Library

The MonetDB distribution comes with a MAPI based interface 
for @url{"http://www.php.net",PHP}. It consists of 2 parts the dynamically
loadable php module, MonetDB.so/dll and a driver for 
the @url{"http://pear.php.net/package/DB",PEAR DB} abstraction interface, MonetDB.php. 

For general compilation of MonetDB see the howto's for Unix and Linux.
The unix configure process normally tries to detect if you have PHP 
including developer packages installed and builds the PHP module only 
if you have it.  With the @code{--with-php} option you could tell 'configure' 
where to find the PHP installation.

For windows setups the story is a little bit more complex.
TODO

When the build process is complete you should have a PHP extension_dir under
your MonetDB prefix directory. Usually this is prefix/lib/php4.
Besides this binary module the pear db driver should be installed under
prefix/php_peardir/db, which usually is prefix/share/pear/db.
Depending on your local setup you could now use these files by coping them
into the system extension_dir and php_peardir or with a private webserver
you could simply reset the environment variables, include_path and
extension_dir. For example you could have a php.ini file which has the following
php section.

@example
[PHP]
safe_mode = Off
safe_mode_gid = Off
include_path = ".:/opt/MonetDB-4.6/share/pear:/usr/share/pear"
extension_dir = /opt/MonetDB-4.6/lib/php4
@end example

@subsection A Simple PHP Example
A tiny example of the use the MonetDB PHP module follows:

@verbatim
<?php

# if monetdb.php isn't installed into the correct pear/DB directory
# we load first 
#require("DB/monetdb.php");
require("DB.php");

function printtable($resultset) {
    echo "<table border='1'>";
    echo "<tr>";
    foreach(array_keys($resultset[0]) as $head) 
	echo "<th>".ucfirst($head)."</th>";
    echo "</tr>";
    
    foreach($resultset as $row) {
	echo "<tr&>";
	foreach($row as $k=&>$v)
	echo "</tr&>";
    } 
    echo "</table&>";
}

// Connect to monet giving a user/password/host; default language is SQL. 
$db = DB::connect("monetdb://monetdb:monetdb@@localhost/");
$db->setFetchMode(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC);
$db->autoCommit(false);

$db->query("CREATE TABLE testtable (name VARCHAR(255), zipcode VARCHAR(10), registered BOOLEAN);");
$db->query("INSERT INTO testtable VALUES('Arjan Scherpenisse', '1092 GJ', true);");
$db->query("INSERT INTO testtable VALUES('Test', '123', false);");

// Get table names
$tables = $db->getCol($db->getSpecialQuery("tables")); 

echo "<p>The following tables are defined: <strong>" . implode(", ", $tables) . "</strong>";

echo "<p>Contents of testtable:";
$all = $db->getAll("SELECT * FROM testtable;");
printtable($all);
 
$db->disconnect();

?>
@end verbatim

More examples can be found in the sources. 

The PEAR::DB driver is based on the MonetDB php module which can
ofcourse also be used directly.  
Check out the @url{"http://www.monetdb.com/MonetDB/Version5//phpdoc",PHPdoc documentation} for these functions.
