Using MonetDB for experimentation and application development
requires installation of the back-end server Mserver, a front-end compiler for 
SQL or XQuery, the APIs, and a (graphical) user interface.
These components are packaged conveniently for several platforms in
the @url{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=56967,download} section at SourceForge.

Most people prefer a version `officially' declared as stable. Stable
means that special care has been taken to assure that all errors reported
during the nightly builds have been solved on the platforms of interest.
Major bug fixes are also applied to the latest stable version, while functional
enhancements are kept for the next release.

Before you embark upon application development, take a quick look at
the tutorial section. It illustrates a small, but concrete application
scenario geared at querying a historical database with trading trips of the
world-famous East-Indian Trading Corp (1602-1795).

If you encounter errors during the installation, please have a look at the
@url{"http://monetdb.cwi.nl/GetGoing/Trouble/FAQ/index.html",FAQ}
for common errors and some advice on how to proceed.

@subsection Software Versions
At the time of writing MonetDB Version 4.9 is distributed worldwide
through SourceForge.
This manual, however, is written within the context of preparing the
launch of MonetDB Version 5, which in many areas is a major
deviance from the earlier releases.

Part of the code base for Version 4 will become depreciated in 2006 as 
development efforts shift to Version 5. Until its pre-release, however,
the new code based is only distributed to a small core group for 
experimentation, tool migration and feedback.
