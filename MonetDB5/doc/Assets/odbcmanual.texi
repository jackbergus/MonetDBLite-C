@section MonetDB ODBC Coupling
Short for Open DataBase Connectivity, a standard database access method
developed by the SQL Access group in 1992. The goal of ODBC is to make it
possible to access any data from any application, regardless of which
database management system (DBMS) is handling the data. ODBC manages this
by inserting a middle layer, called a database driver, between an application
and the DBMS. The purpose of this layer is to translate the application's data
queries into commands that the DBMS understands. For this to work, both the
application and the DBMS must be ODBC-compliant -- that is, the application
must be capable of issuing ODBC commands and the DBMS must be capable of
responding to them.

The ODBC driver for MonetDB is included in the Windows installer and Linux
RPMs.  The source can be found in the @emph{SQL} CVS tree.

To help you setup your system to use the ODBC driver with MonetDB,
two how-tos are available, one for Windows users and one for Linux/UNIX
users.
