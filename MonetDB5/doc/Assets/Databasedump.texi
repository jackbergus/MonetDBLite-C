@subsection Database Dumps
An alternative scheme to safeguard and transport a SQL database is to produce
an @sc{ascii}-based database dump. 
This option is standard available for the @sc{mclient} and @sc{mjClient}. 
However, be prepared that not all SQL schema features may be retained 
in the process. It also takes much more time to produce the dump file.

Consider you have already installed the SQL tutorial database @sc{VOC}
and wish to transport it to another machine. The following steps are
required after you have started the database server.
@example
shell> mclient -lsql --dump >/tmp/voc.sql
@end example
You can inspect the file @sc{/tmp/voc.sql} to confirm that indeed
a compact database dump is available. Move this file over to the new
machine. The @sc{monetdb} script can be used to create the database
and start the server. Once done, it suffices to feed the dump file
to a MonetDB client program to populate the database.
@example
shell> monetdb --start --dbname=voc
....
shell> mclient -lsql /tmp/voc.sql
@end example

The dump facility is also avaible as an option to the @sc{monetdb} script.
It tags the dump and stores it away in the checkpoint directory.
