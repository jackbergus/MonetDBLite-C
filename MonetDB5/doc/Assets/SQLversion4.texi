@appendix Version 4 Differences
@section Start and Stop the Server

The Version 4 server does not come with a guardian process.
The server is an executable program called @code{Mserver},
whose permissible arguments can be obtained running
@verbatim
Mserver --help
@end verbatim

@section Checkpoint and Recovery
The Version 4 server does not come with a checkpoint and
recovery scheme.

@section Database Dumps
The Version 4 server is based in the functional 
identical @code{MapiClient} user interface.

@section Textual Client Interface
The Version 4 server is based in the functional 
identical @code{MapiClient} user interface.

Console interaction, however, is MIL, which comes
with a completely different command set.
Information about a function can be obtained using
the @code{help(<string>)} command.

@section SQL 
The client interface for version 4 is MapiClient
and the examples are based. Furthermore, the
results produced by the SQL statement modifiers
are focussed on MIL, rather then MAL.

@section Optimizer
The SQL compiler for version 4 does not provide
access to back-end specific optimizers.

@section Overlaying BATs
Version 4 only understands MIL.
