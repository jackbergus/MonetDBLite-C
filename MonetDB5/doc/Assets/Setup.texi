@subsection Source Development Distribution

The source distribution is needed if you intend to inspect or extend 
the code base. The source distribution comes
with the complete test-bench to assure that changes do not affect
(in as far as they get tested) its stability.

A single stable release is maintained for external users while 
we concurrently work on the next release.
Older versions are not actively maintained by the development team.

The development version can be obtained from the CVS repository at SourceForge.
You have to login to the CVS server first:
@verbatim
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb login
@end verbatim
Just type RETURN when asked for the password.
Then get the MonetDB and sql module sources by using the command:
@verbatim
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/monetdb checkout MonetDB sql
@end verbatim

This will create the directories MonetDB and sql in your current working directory, which hold the sources.
Read the MonetDB installation instructions for 
@url{http://monetdb.cwi.nl/xyz,Unix} or
@url{http://monetdb.cwi.nl/xyz,Windows}
to successfully compile and install these sources.  
For SQL installation, see the corresponding documentation in
@url{http://monetdb.cwi.nl/xyz,Linux}
or
@url{http://monetdb.cwi.nl/xyz,Windows}
Furthermore, take special care by also reading the 
test web guidelines (pxref(The Test Web)).


The code base can also be studied online.  See the
@url{http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/monetdb/, 
MonetDB CVS tree}.

@emph{WARNING:} To use the SQL and MonetDB development versions, you
should check out the latest version of @emph{both}.  They are kept in sync
and rely on each other.
