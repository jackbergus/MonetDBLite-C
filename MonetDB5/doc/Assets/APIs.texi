@section Application Programming Interfaces
MonetDB comes with a complete set of programming libraries.
Their basis is the Mapi library, which describes the protocol understood
by the server.
The Perl,PHP, and Python library are mostly wrappers around 
the Mapi routines.

The programming interface is based on a client-server architecture, 
where the client program connects to a server using a TCP-IP connection
to exchange commands and receives ansers. The underlying protocol
uses plain UTF-8 data for ease of use and debugging.
This leads to publically visible information exchange over a network,
which may be undesirable.
Therefore, a private and secure channel can be set up with 
the Secure Socket Layer functionality being offered.

A more tightly connection between application logic
and database server is described in @ref{Embedded MonetDB}.
