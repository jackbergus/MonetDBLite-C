@subsection Embedded MonetDB Roadmap
The embedded MonetDB software family provides support for both
SQL and XQuery (Version 4 only). The software has been tuned to
run on small scale hardware platforms.

A broader deployment of the embedded technology requires both 
extensions in the distributed MonetDB versions and its replication
services. Continual attention is given to the memory footprint and cpu/io
resource consumptions on embedded devices.

A separate project, called the Datacell, is underway and geared at
providing a streaming environment for embedded applications.
The supportive modules are scheduled for release in 2006.
