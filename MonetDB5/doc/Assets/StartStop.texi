@section Start and Stop the Server
Starting and stopping the server under Windows doesn't need an
extensive description. Just close the window of the server and
it ceases to exist.

Once downloaded and installed MonetDB on your Linux system,
it is adviceable to check its functionality with the following actions:
@example
> monetdb --help
@end example
It should respond with something like

@verbatim
Usage: monetdb [command] [options] [script]
Primary command:
    --start         Server(s) are started in the dbfarm
    --shutdown      Server(s) are gracefully stopped
    --status        Show the server status 
    --checkpoint    Create a database checkpoint
    --log           Show the server management log

Secondary options:
    --dbname=<database_name>
    --dbfarm=<directory>
    --dbinit=<stmt>           Server prepare statement
    --config=<config_file>    Configuration file
    --debug=<number>          Trace server actions[0]
    --daemon=yes|no           Run in background [no]
    --set <option>=<value>    Set environment value
    --help                    This list of options
@end verbatim

An error messages typically indicate a wrongly configured $PATH variable, 
making the @code{monetdb} program
invisible to your shell. Retrace your installation steps.

An access mode violation indicates that either the directory path
to the location of the MonetDB data store does not exists, or the
user has lack of file system permissions to create new directories/files
in the location specified.

To start the MonetDB server for the default database simply type
@example
> monetdb --dbname=voc
@end example
It responds with a message that this action 
was successful, or an error message explains the problems encountered.
The server is run as a daemon process and you need a 
MonetDB client program to connect to it.
More details on the server calling and configuration parameters are
given in @ref{Architecture overview}.

At any time you can inspect the status of the (running) servers
using the command option @code{--status}.
@example
>monetdb --status
DBNAME  PID     GUARD   STARTED                         STATUS
voc     25679   7,25841 Sun Dec 11 13:44:06 2005
@end example
A particular server kan be put to sleep using the @code{--stop}
option.  
All actions of monetdb are logged for post analysis.
