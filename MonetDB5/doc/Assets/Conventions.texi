@section Manual Generation
The MonetDB code base is large collection of files, scattered
over the system modules. Each source file is written in a
literal programming style, which physically binds documentation with 
the relevant code sections. The utility program Mx processes these
files marked *.mx to extract the code sections for system
compilation or to prepare for a pretty printed listing.

The reference manual is based *.mx files prepared for @emph{Texinfo} processing. 
The components for the reference manual are extracted by
@example
Mx -i -B -H1 <filename>.mx
@end example
which generates the file <filename>.bdy.texi.
These pieces are collected and
glued together in a manual framework, running @emph{makeinfo} to produce
the desired output format.
The @emph{Texinfo} information is currently limited
to the documentation, it should be extended to also process the code.

A printable version of an *.mx file can be produced using the commands:
@example
Mx  <filename>.mx
latex <filename>.tex
@end example
The result, however, still includes the unexpanded tex info macros.

@section Software Versions
At the time of writing MonetDB Version 4.9 is distributed worldwide
through SourceForge.
This manual, however, is written within the context of preparing the
launch of MonetDB Version 5, which in many areas is a major
deviance from the earlier releases.

Part of the code base for Version 4 will become depreciated in 2006 as 
development efforts shift to Version 5. Until its pre-release, however,
the new code based is only distributed to a small core group for 
experimentation, tool migration and feedback.

@section Conventions and Notation
The  typographical conventions used in this manual are straightforward.
@code{Monospaced} text is used to designate names in the code base
and examples. 
@emph{Italics} is used in explanations to indicate where a user
supplied value should be substituted.

Snippets of code are illustrated in verbatim font. 
The interaction with textual client interfaces uses the default 
prompt-setting of the underlying operating system. 

Keywords in the MonetDB interface languages are key sensitive;
SQL keywords are not case sensitive. No distinction is made
in this manual.

@section Additional Resources
Although this reference manual aims to be complete for developing
applications with MonetDB, it also depends on
additional resources for a full understanding.

This reference manual relies on documentation of the basics of its
query languages SQL, XQuery, its application interfaces, PHP, Perl,
Pyhton, and its middleware support, JDBC and ODBC, given elsewhere.
Examples are used to illustrate their behaviour in the context of
MonetDB only.
The resource locations identified below may at times proof valuable.

itself.  Information on the background of its architecture can be found
