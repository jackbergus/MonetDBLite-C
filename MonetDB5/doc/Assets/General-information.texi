MonetDB is an open-source high-performance database system developed at 
@url{_ROOTURL_/Development/Developers/, CWI}, the Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science Research in The Netherlands.
Thru several iterations of functional enhancements, both in a commercial
and research setting, it has matured to claim
its position amongst other major open-source solutions.

MonetDB excells in the area of decision support applications,
where queries combine tables with hundreds of columns and 
multi-million rows. 
It can be used in application areas that performance-wise 
are no-go areas for using traditional database technology in a real-time 
manner. 
MonetDB has been successfully applied in demanding applications for 
data mining, 
@acronym{OLAP,On-Line Analytical Processing}, 
@acronym{GIS,Geographic Information System}, 
@acronym{XML, "eXtensible Markup Language},
text- and multimedia retrieval.

MonetDB achieves this goal using innovations at all layers of a DBMS: 
a storage model based on vertical fragmentation, a modern CPU-tuned 
vectorized query execution architecture that often gives it a more 
than 10-fold raw speed advantage on the same algorithm over
a typical interpreter-based RDBMS. 
MonetDB is one of the first database systems to focus its algorithm 
and query optimization effort on exploiting CPU caches. 
MonetDB also features automatic and self-tuning indexes, run-time 
query optimization, a modular software architecture, etc..

and implementation of MonetDB can be found in our
