The MonetDB/XQuery database system manages a @url{ListDoc,document collection}.
Users can @url{AddDoc,add documents} and @url{DelDoc,remove documents}
to this collection by hand, giving them a logical name. Even without this, MonetDB/XQuery
can query any XML document on the web for which you know a working URL.
In that case, the document is automatically imported at query-time, and 
a @url{Cache,caching policy} determines whether and how long it stays in 
the database.

This page describes the interface for managing the document
collection and the caching policy. These features are not covered
by the W3C XQuery language itself, however. Therefore, for the moment,
the management of these features is handled in MonetDB/XQuery  
through some special commands added to the MIL algebra, that can
either be typed into the @code{Mserver} console directly, 
or by making use of @url{'../../../../MonetDB/Version4/Documentation/Tools/MapiClient/',MapiClient}
interface in MIL interaction mode (i.e. @strong{without} the @code{-lx} 
option @url{../APIs/MapiClient,to use MapiClient for XQuery interaction}).

In the next version (0.14), we add new XQuery @strong{builtin functions}
integrated in the update framework to allow document management to
be performed using XQuery statements.
