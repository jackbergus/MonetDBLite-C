The query Wcode@{doc("HelloWorld.xml")@} won't work anymore and 
returns an error message accordingly.

If you wish to delete all documents from the collection, type:
@verbatim
  mil> delete_all_docs(true);
  mil>
@end verbatim
to delete only the (implicitely) cached documents, or
@verbatim
  mil> delete_all_docs(false);
  mil>
@end verbatim
to delete also the (explicitely) shredded documents.
