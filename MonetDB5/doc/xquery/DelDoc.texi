The query @code{doc("HelloWorld.xml")} won't work anymore and 
returns an error message accordingly.

If you wish to delete all documents from the collection, type:
@verbatim
  > delete_all_docs(true);
  >
@end verbatim
to delete only cached documents, or
@verbatim
  > delete_all_docs(false);
  >
@end verbatim
to delete also the (explicitely) shredded documents.
