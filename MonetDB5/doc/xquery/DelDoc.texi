You can delete the "HelloWorld.xml" document from the collection
using its logical name.
@verbatim
  % MapiClient -lmil
  # Monet Database Server V4.8.2

  # Compiled for i686-redhat-linux-gnu/32bit; dynamically linked.

  mil>delete_doc("HelloWorld.xml");
  mil>\q
@end verbatimm

The query Wcode{doc("HelloWorld.xml")} won't work anymore and 
returns an error message accordingly.

If you wish to delete all documents from the collection, type:
@verbatim
  mil> delete_all_docs(true);
  mil>
@end verbatimm
to delete only the (implicitely) cached documents, or
@verbatim
  mil> delete_all_docs(false);
  mil>
@end verbatimm
to delete also the (explicitely) shredded documents.
