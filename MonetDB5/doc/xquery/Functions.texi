MonetDB/XQuery supports a wide range of the built-in functions described in
the @url{http://www.w3.org/,W3C} specifications. This section provides
an overview is  of functions that MonetDB/XQuery currently supports. 

The function library has been organized as follows:
@table @code
@item Aggregation functions (@code{min,max, ..}).  
@strong{supported: 6/8} Missing functions are all collation specific,
@xref{XQuery Aggregation}.

@item Numeric computation functions (@code{+ -, ..}). 
@strong{supported: 18/20} No support yet of @code{round-half-to-even},
@xref{XQuery Numeric}.

@item Boolean logic or comparison functions (@code{and, &gt;, ..}). 
@strong{supported: 9/13} We miss @code{deep-equal} and @code{binaryEqual} variants,
@xref{XQuery Boolean}.

@item String functions (@code{substring, ..}). 
@strong{supported: 21/32} We miss collation-speific versions as well as @code{normalize-unicode} and @code{tokenize},
@xref{XQuery String}.

@item Node functions (@code{root, doc, ..}).
@strong{supported: 17/23},
@xref{XQuery Node}.

@item Sequence functions (@code{first, last, ..}). 
@strong{supported: 11/19} No support for @code{collection} yet,
@xref{XQuery Sequence}.

@item URI functions (@code{base-uri, escape-uri, ..}). 
@strong{supported: 2/10} We only have @code{namespace-uri},
@xref{XQuery URI}.

@item QName functions (@code{node-name, resolve-QName, ..}). 
@strong{supported: 0/6} Not supported yet,
@xref{XQuery QName}.

@item Runtime functions(@code{error, trace ..}). 
@strong{supported: 0/5} Not supported yet,
@xref{XQuery Runtime}.

@item Date/Time functions(@code{date-equal, time-less-than, ..}). 
@strong{supported: 0/75} Not supported yet,
@xref{XQuery Date/Time}.
@end table

We encourage new @url{_ROOTURL_/Development,Developers} to volunteer and
help fill in these blanks. Work has started on adding date/time functions
but help is surely welcome.
