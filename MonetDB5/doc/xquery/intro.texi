@chapter XQuery 
@section XQuery Introduction
For a quick impression of how MonetDB/XQuery is used, we 
recommend reading the @url{_ROOTDIR_/XQuery/Version4/QuickTour,QuickTour} first. 

The documentation is organized by feature area:
@itemize
@item 
@ref{Supported Features} section 
describes which features from the various W3C standard recommendations
have been implemented, and which not. You will find that MonetDB/XQuery
is very standard-conformant already at this stage.
@item 
Adding XML documents to a database, as well as deleting them, is 
not yet covered by the W3C. Thus, MonetDB/XQuery provides its own interface 
for such tasks, See @ref{Document Management} for more details.
@item 
@ref{The Mapi Library} describes how users and application 
programmers can interact with MonetDB/XQuery, either by invoking the
the @value{mclient} utility on XQuery scripts, or by querying
the MonetDB/XQuery server from a client program. We also describe
how to use MonetDB/XQuery as XML database backbone behind a web server.
@item 
@ref{Prepared Queries} to accelerate repetitive 
fast-running queries, are a well-known feature in SQL databases.  
MonetDB/XQuery uses XQuery user-defined functions, defined in library 
modules (standard features in W3C XQuery 1.0) to bring the benefits of 
prepared queries also to XML database systems.
@item 
@ref{StandOff Extensions} introduce new  XPath steps to 
ease querying of XML documents with so-called @strong{region-annotations}.  
The decision to extend a W3C standard is not taken lightly, and was only 
done after users from widely different backgrounds found these extensions 
critical. Also, these extensions are @strong{turned off by default} and need 
to be actived explicitly by starting the MonetDB/XQuery server with the 
@code{--set standoff=enable} command-line switch.
