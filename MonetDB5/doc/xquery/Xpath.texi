@section XQuery Features
The XPath language is a sub-set of the XQuery language. It is fully supported in MonetDB/XQuery.

It is not our intention to maintain documentation for the XPath language. If you are looking for the 
XPath language reference, please visit the @url{http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/,W3C XPath Specification} page.
