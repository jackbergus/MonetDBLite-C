  combined with GROUP BY"

* Mon Jul 12 2010 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100712
- Make queries like (SELECT ...) UNION ALL (SELECT ...) ORDER BY ...;
  work, again, that were broken since Jun 22 2010 triggering errors
  like "ORDER BY: missing select operator"

* Fri Jul  9 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100712

- Make TEXT a separate keyword, separating it from CLOB, such that we

* Mon Jul  5 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100706
- Fixed bug in zero_or_one
- Fixed bug in dead code elimination for projections with distinct
- Fixed bug handling join with constant values on both sides (like

* Wed Jun 30 2010 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.3-20100706
- fixed bug 2564: in case group by column is not found as alias in
  projection list, fall back to check plain input columns in order to
  find the underlying BAT and check its sortedness

* Thu Jun 24 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100625
- make it possible to use '?' in offset and limit

* Fri Jun 18 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.1-20100622
- Added include and .lib files to Windows installers that are needed
  to compile client programs.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Thu Apr  8 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 2.36.5-20100420
- fixed bug #2983773 "SQL: minimal optimizer pipe unstable"
