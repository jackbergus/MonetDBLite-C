/**
 * A Socket for communicating with the MonetDB database in block mode.
 * <br /><br />
 * This MonetSocket performs basic operations like sending the server a
 * message and/or receiving a line from it.  A small interpretation of
 * all what is read is done, to supply some basic tools for the using
 * classes.<br />
 * For each read line, it is determined what type of line it is
 * according to the MonetDB MAPI protocol.i  This results in a line to
 * be PROMPT, HEADER, RESULT, ERROR or UNKNOWN.i  Use the getLineType()
 * function to retrieve the type of the last line read.
 * <br /><br />
 * For debugging purposes a socket level debugging is implemented where
 * each and every interaction to and from the MonetDB server is logged
 * to a file on disk.<br />
 * Incoming messages are prefixed by "RX" (received by the driver),
 * outgoing messages by "TX" (transmitted by the driver).  Special
 * decoded non-human readable messages are prefixed with "RD" and "TD"
 * instead.  Following this two char prefix, a timestamp follows as
 * the number of milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.  The rest of the
 * line is a String representation of the data sent or received.
 * <br /><br />
 * This implementation of MonetSocket uses block mode on the mapi
 * protocol.  It allows sending a multi line query as data is sent in
 * 'blocks' that are prefixed with a two byte integer indicating its
 * size.  The least significant bit of this integer represents the last
 * block in a sequence.
