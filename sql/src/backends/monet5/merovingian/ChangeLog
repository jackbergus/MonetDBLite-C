# ChangeLog file for sql/src/backends/monet5
# This file is updated with mchangelog (Gentoo echangelog bastard script)

  19 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.c,
  merovingian.1:
  Increase the default mero_exittimeout from 7 to 60 seconds.

  19 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> monetdb.1, monetdb.c:
  Restrict database names created by monetdb to the pattern [A-Za-z0-9-_]+.

  17 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.c, monetdb.c:
  props = 1837591

  16 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> monetdb.c:
  Fixed bug where destroying multiple databases without -f would abort after
  the first database.

  08 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> monetdb.c:
  Avoid multiple questions by merging them into a single confirmation for the
  destroy command.  This accidently fixes a bug where a response such as 'yes'
  would abort the next database removal.

  04 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.1, merovingian.c:
  Implemented a configurable port for the neighbour discovery service. This
  also allows to entirely disable neighbour discovery by setting
  mero_discoveryport to 0.  Feature request #2800964

  02 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.c, monetdb.c:
  monetdb now copies the sql_logdir setting at the time of a create as a
  property for merovingian.  This way, databases under merovingian's
  control are safe from sql_logdir changes in the monetdb5.conf file.
  This is a good thing, since any change will lead to a database that
  cannot and won't startup.  In the future it can become possible to
  change the logdir location via monetdb.

  02 Jun 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> monetdb.c:
  Implemented dynamic width of monetdb status output. If a database name is
  wider than 14 chars, the name column is made wider as long as the
  terminal window allows.  If a column cannot be made any wider this
  way, it is abbreviated as before.

*May2009

  15 May 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.1, merovingian.mx:
  Implemented Feature Request #2705670.  Reopen logfiles when SIGHUP is
  received.

  13 May 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.1, merovingian.mx:
  Implemented feature request #2782776. All logged messages are now prefixed
  with a timestamp.

*Feb2009-SP2

  21 Apr 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx, monetdb.1:
  Instead of sending SIGTERM and immediately returning, call the
  terminateProcess function such that we nicely wait for the process to have
  died, and eventually send a SIGKILL if that fails. Fixes bug #2747661

  30 Mar 2009; Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@cwi.nl> monetdb.mx:
  If the logdir argument to logger_create is a relative path name, the
  logdir will be located inside the dbfarm/dbname directory.  If it is
  an absolute path name, that path is used.  Fixed monetdb destroy with
  regard to this new behaviour.

*Feb2009-SP1

  23 Mar 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Remove the pid file upon shutdown, fixes bug #2705666

  02 Mar 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> monetdb.mx:
  Small cosmetic fix not to overflow the uptime in monetdb status display

  23 Feb 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> ChangeLog:
  Fix hang on Linux when shutting down. select() calls are not interrupted on
  Linux, so make sure they time out. Fixes bug #2623838

  19 Feb 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Fixed crash of merovingian when a to be started database terminates
  immediately after startup (such as when it crashes)

  16 Feb 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Protect shared linked list structures from being accessed and/or modified by
  two or more threads concurrently. This resolves random crashes. Fixes bug
  #2605706

  16 Feb 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> monetdb.mx:
  Fixed crash when using monetdb stop on a non-started database.  Bug #2605105

  02 Feb 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Create logfiles when they do not exist.  Bug #2556973

*Feb2009

  28 Dec 2008; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Switched internally to select() calls instead of non-blocking IO loops. This
  reduces the CPU usage in idlestate considerably.

  28 Dec 2008; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Properly handle SIGHUP, such that merovingian does not silently terminate

  08 Dec 2008; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.1:
  Fix manpage header
