# ChangeLog file for sql/src/backends/monet5
# This file is updated with mchangelog (Gentoo echangelog bastard script)

  15 May 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.1, merovingian.mx:
  Implemented Feature Request #2705670.  Reopen logfiles when SIGHUP is received.

  13 May 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.1, merovingian.mx:
  Implemented feature request #2782776. All logged messages are now prefixed
  with a timestamp.

  21 Apr 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx, monetdb.1:
  Instead of sending SIGTERM and immediately returning, call the
  terminateProcess function such that we nicely wait for the process to have
  died, and eventually send a SIGKILL if that fails. Fixes bug #2747661

  30 Mar 2009; Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@cwi.nl> monetdb.mx:
  If the logdir argument to logger_create is a relative path name, the
  logdir will be located inside the dbfarm/dbname directory.  If it is
  an absolute path name, that path is used.  Fixed monetdb destroy with
  regard to this new behaviour.

  23 Feb 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> ChangeLog:
  Fix hang on Linux when shutting down. select() calls are not interrupted on

  Fixed crash of merovingian when a to be started database terminates
  immediately after startup (such as when it crashes)

  16 Feb 2009; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Protect shared linked list structures from being accessed and/or modified by
  two or more threads concurrently. This resolves random crashes. Fixes bug

*Feb2009

  28 Dec 2008; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Switched internally to select() calls instead of non-blocking IO loops. This
  reduces the CPU usage in idlestate considerably.

  28 Dec 2008; Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> merovingian.mx:
  Properly handle SIGHUP, such that merovingian does not silently terminate
