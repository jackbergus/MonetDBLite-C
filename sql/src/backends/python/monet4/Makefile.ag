#  Both GNU's gcc and Intel's icc do not like to compile swig-generated code
#  with our strict X_CFLAGS.
#  Instead of diabling the strict X_CFLAGS completely,
#  we use GCC_SWIG_CFLAGS and ICC_SWIG_CFLAGS, respectively,
#  to disable only the problematic warnings/errors as locally as possbile.
#  See buildtools/conf/MonetDB.m4 for details.

#  However, there are situations where user-chosen CFLAGS and/or X_CFLAGS
#  are beyond our control. Hence, for the sake of a smooth compilation, we
#  have to take the freedom to overrule the user's deliberate choice for
#  X_CFLAGS by locally disabling them indifferently.
