# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu Feb  1 2018 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added new system view: sys.ids which contains all database objects
  ids which can be used in sys.dependencies table.
- Added new system view: sys.dependencies_vw which shows all data of
  sys.dependencies including names on objects, object types and dependency types.
- Added new system views for finding out dependencies between database objects.
  These new dependency views improve, extend and replace the
  sys.dependencies_X_on_Y() functions as previously defined in
  21_dependency_functions.sql.
  The sys.dependencies_X_on_Y() functions are now marked as deprecated.
- Added new system view: sys.roles which contains all defined roles.
- Added new system view: sys.var_values which shows the values for
  system variables.

* Thu Dec  7 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Removed system function sys.environment(). It was a duplicate of system
  function sys.env().

* Thu Nov  9 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Implemented behavior for DROP SCHEMA my_schema RESTRICT command.
  Previously the RESTRICT keyword was accepted but not obeyed. It would
  always do a CASCADE operation.  Also the default behavior of DROP SCHEMA
  my_schema command is now changed into RESTRICT behavior (was CASCADE).

* Tue Nov  7 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- The internal NULL representation of the REAL (FLOAT) and DOUBLE
  types was changed from the smallest representable finite value to NaN
  (not-a-number).

* Wed Aug 30 2017 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- A column default value can be used in a UPDATE statement: UPDATE tname
  SET cname = DEFAULT, and INSERT statements: INSERT INTO tname VALUES
  (..., DEFAULT, ...)
- Added TRUNCATE statements into the SQL catalog, conforming to the SQL
  standard. In a TRUNCATE statement a 'CONTINUE IDENTITY' or 'RESTART
  IDENTITY' clause can be passed mrestart or not, being the former the
  default one. The options 'RESTRICT' and 'CASCADE' tell if the table has
  foreign key references, the referencing tables should be truncated as
  well. This happens on 'CASCADE' and 'RESTRICT' is the default behavior.

* Tue Aug  1 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Lots of changes to streamline the internal error handling.
  In principle, all errors should now include a SQLSTATE error code
  (see the SQL standard).

* Thu Jul 20 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added support for extracting the quarter (number between 1 and 4)
  of a date or a timestamp or a timestamp with timezone in SQL:
   EXTRACT ( QUARTER FROM my_date_expr ).
  Added support for extracting the week (number between 1 and 53)
  of a date or a timestamp or a timestamp with timezone in SQL:
   EXTRACT ( WEEK FROM my_date_expr ).
  Added support for scalar functions: quarter(date_expr),
  quarter(timestamp_expr) and quarter(timestamptz_expr).
