# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

- Some names in the SQL catalog were changed.  This means that the
  database in the Apr2011 release is not compatible with pre-Apr2011
  databases.  The database is converted automatically when opened the
  first time.  This database can then no longer be read by an older
  release.
