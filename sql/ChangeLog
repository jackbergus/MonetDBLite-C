- The experimental recycler code is moved to the attic.

* Wed Jul  6 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl>
- The syntax of bat.new(:oid,:any) has been changed by dropping the
  superflous :oid.  All BATs are now binary associations between a void
  column and a materialized value column.  (except for the internal
  :bat[:void,:void] representation of simple oid ranged tails.)
