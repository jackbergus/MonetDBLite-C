- Removed table sys.connections.  It was a remnant of an experimental
  change that had already been removed in 2012.

* Tue Nov  8 2016 Martin Kersten <mk@cwi.nl>
- Protect against runaway profiler events If you hit a barrier block
  during profiling, the JSON event log may quickly become unwieldy. Event
  production is protected using a high water mark, which ensures that
  never within the single execution of MAL block the instruction causes
  excessive event records.
