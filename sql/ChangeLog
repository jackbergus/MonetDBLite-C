- Extended grantable schema privileges: when a user is granted the
  "sysadmin" role, the user now hcan not only create schemas, but
  also drop schemas.
- Introduced COPY INTO/ COPY FROM global privileges. These privileges
  allows other users than 'monetdb' to be granted the privileges
  to use the MonetDB bulk data loading/exporting features, i.e.,
  COPY FROM <file> and COPY INTO <file>.
