# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed Aug 30 2017 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- A column default value can be used in a UPDATE statement: UPDATE tname
  SET cname = DEFAULT, and INSERT statements: INSERT INTO tname VALUES
  (..., DEFAULT, ...)
- Added TRUNCATE statements into the SQL catalog, conforming to the SQL
  standard. In a TRUNCATE statement a 'CONTINUE IDENTITY' or 'RESTART
  IDENTITY' clause can be passed mrestart or not, being the former the
  default one. The options 'RESTRICT' and 'CASCADE' tell if the table has
  foreign key references, the referencing tables should be truncated as
  well. This happens on 'CASCADE' and 'RESTRICT' is the default behavior.

* Tue Aug  1 2017 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Lots of changes to streamline the internal error handling.
  In principle, all errors should now include a SQLSTATE error code
  (see the SQL standard).

* Thu Jul 20 2017 Martin van Dinther <martin.van.dinther@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added support for extracting the quarter (number between 1 and 4)
  of a date or a timestamp or a timestamp with timezone in SQL:
   EXTRACT ( QUARTER FROM my_date_expr ).
  Added support for extracting the week (number between 1 and 53)
  of a date or a timestamp or a timestamp with timezone in SQL:
   EXTRACT ( WEEK FROM my_date_expr ).
  Added support for scalar functions: quarter(date_expr),
  quarter(timestamp_expr) and quarter(timestamptz_expr).
