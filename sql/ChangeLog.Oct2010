- Security related fixes to the COPY INTO commands: 1) binary COPY INTO
  is disallowed for non-administrator users, 2) COPY INTO using a path
  both for reading and writing is disallowed for non-administrator users,
  3) paths used with COPY INTO may not be relative, and 4) COPY INTO a
  file may only be writing to a non-existing file
