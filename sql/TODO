  Keep list of related sequence number with tables.  For two reasons:
  1) ease of cleanup/drop handling, and 2) cheaper implementations of
  identity columns.  Also related (?) detect dependencies of tables upon
  sequences to warn/cascade during DROP.

  "Generated columns" which are evaluated when they are needed.  The
  idea is to have some piece of MAL code that is just inserted before
  the actual bind.  This would solve problems for the authorisation
  system in M5 and can solve SEQUENCES which now have sneaky inplace
  transactions.

  Mapi speed-up.  The tuples in Mapi output can (and should) be sent in
  a more effective way.  This requires some big changes, but should
  bring us closer to MySQL and friends by lowering our protocol
  overhead.
