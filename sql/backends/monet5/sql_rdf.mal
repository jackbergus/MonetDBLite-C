comment "Procedure that wraps around the shredder of the rdf module in MAL. 
Shredding an RDF data file from location results in 7 new tables (6 
permutations of SPO and a mapping) in the RDF schema and an entry to table 
rdf.graph We can then query with SQL queries the RDF triple storeby quering 
tables gid_spo, gid_pso etc., where gid is looked up in rdf.graph"
