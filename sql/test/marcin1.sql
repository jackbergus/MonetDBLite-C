-- and now some strange queries and even stranger results

-- cartesian-product missing
select * from t1,t2 order by t1.id, t1.val, t2.id, t2.val;

-- These actually give good results (cartesian-product like):
select t1.id,t2.id from t1,t2 where t1.id<>t2.id;
select t1.id,t2.id from t1,t2 where t1.id>t2.id;

-- does not work (and should, assuming ids are unique)
select t1.id, (select t2.id from t2 where t1.id=t2.id) from t1;

-- As the sub-select returns a single value (3), no error occures
select t1.id, (select t2.id from t2 where t2.id>2) from t1;

-- Return only columns from first table
select * from t2,t1 where t1.id=t2.id;
select * from t1,t2 where t1.id=t2.id;

-- I'm not sure if t2.* is allowed but anyway it's strange
select * from t2;
select t2.* from t2;

-- wrong subsets
select * from t1 where id>2;
select * from t1 where id>2 and id<2;
