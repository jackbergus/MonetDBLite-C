Compiling MonetDB with SWIG
===========================

It is possible to use the `Simplified Wrapper and Interface
Generator`__ (SWIG) to generate source files that can be compiled into
a library which can be used from other languages to interface to
MonetDB.  At the moment only the `Python`__ interface has been tried on
`MinGW`__.

In order to do this, make sure the `Cygwin`__ package swig and the Windows
version of `Python`__ are installed (the Cygwin package python is required
for building autogen which is part of the buildtools; here we need the
Windows version of Python), and replace the configure option

::

 --without-swig

with::

 --with-swig \
 --with-python=C:/Python24/python.exe \
 --with-python-libdir=lib/site-packages \
 --with-python-incdir=C:/Python24/include \
 --with-python-library='-LC:/Python24/libs -lpython24'

(this is assuming Python for Windows was installed in the default
location of ``C:\Python24``).
