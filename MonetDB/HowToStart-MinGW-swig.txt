It is possible to use the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator
(SWIG) to generate source files that can be compiled into a library
which can be used from other languages to interface to MonetDB.  At
the moment only the Python interrface has been tried on MinGW.

In order to do this, make sure the Cygwin package swig and the Windows
version of Python are installed (the Cygwin package python is required
for building autogen which is part of the buildtools; here we need the
Windows version of Python), and replace the configure option
--without-swig with:
	--with-swig \
	--with-python=C:/Python24/python.exe \
	--with-python-libdir=lib/site-packages \
	--with-python-incdir=C:/Python24/include \
	--with-python-library='-LC:/Python24/libs -lpython24'

(this is assuming Python for Windows was installed in the default
location of C:\Python24).
