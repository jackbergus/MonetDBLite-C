monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Various concurrency bugs were fixed.
  * Various changes were made to run better on systems that don't have enough
    memory to keep everything in core that was touched during query processing.
    This is done by having the higher layers giving hints to the database
    kernel about future use, and the database kernel giving hings to the
    operating system kernel about how (virtual) memory is going to be used.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added implementation of MT_getrss() for Solaris.  This yields in the
    kernel knowing about its (approximate) memory usage to try and help
    the operating system to free that memory that is best to free, instead
    of a random page, e.g. the work of the vmtrim thread.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented a "fast" string BAT append:
    Under certain conditions, instead of inserting values one-by-one,
    we now concatenate the string heap wholesale and just manipulate
    the offsets.
    This works both for BATins and BATappend.

monetdb (1.36.1-20100223) unstable; urgency=low

    strings.
  * Changed the implementation of the string offset columns to be
    dynamically sized.
