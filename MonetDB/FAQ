3) Which application programming interfaces exist?
4) How do I use the SQL and XQuery front-end?

1) Why does Mserver complain about a missing initialization script?

Running a server in daemon mode requires initialization of the server
context.  The actions are read from a file passed as the last argument
on the command string.  An example of such a script would be the
sql_server.mil script in the lib/MonetDB directory.

2) How do I run a Perl (Python, C, Java, ...) application?

The MonetDB source tree contains a section Mapi/clients, where you
also find sample applications to interact with the server.  For most
APIs we have included a simple textual monitor to show the basic
interaction, called MapiClient.  Try this one first before developing
your own applications.

3) Which application programming interfaces exist?


MonetDB contains low-level TCP-IP libraries to setup a communication
channel from programs written in C, Java, Perl, PHP, Python.  ODBC
and JDBC drivers are also available.

For both ODBC and JDBC holds that only an elementary subset of the
APIs are implemented, and some of their functionalities are not yet
fully tested.  See the documentation of the respective API for more
information on supported and unsupported features.

The most extensive library for interaction is Mapi, which provides a
proprietary cached tabular abstraction for queries.  It comes in a
C and Java version.  Consult the documentation of the libraries for
more information on their functionalities.

4) How do I use the SQL and XQuery front-ends?

For MonetDB, SQL and XQuery functionality are separate modules, which
are also in the SourceForge repository. It should be checked out in 
much the same way as MonetDB itself (change 'MonetDB' into 'sql' for 
the SQL front-end and in 'pathfinder' for the XQuery front-end). In 
the root directory of the sql/pathfinder distribution you find the 
HowtoStart document, which contains step-by-step instructions.
