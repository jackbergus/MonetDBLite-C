# ChangeLog file for MonetDB
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Fri Aug 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Fixed a bug where some internal reference counting was done incorrectly,
  causing an infinite loop when exiting the server due to it being killed.
  This bug probably only manifested itself in MonetDB/XQuery.  Bug 2658.
